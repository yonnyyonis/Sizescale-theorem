Right now â€œmy workâ€ is 9 proper texts and a few videos. They all talk about the same thing (which can be formulated as: IÂ´ll say as much as I can about things IÂ´ve never heard anyone else say (and IÂ´ve seen the best professors in the world teaching truths)). To cause a rift in the taliban/ISIS and stop the war by making group-bonding (around a holy book) problematic/impossible, my whole â€œworkâ€ doesnÂ´t need to be dropped as propaganda books on top of ISIS and the taliban. ItÂ´s enough that the news headlines say that â€œa correct all-explaining existential theory has been found â€“ religions in crysisâ€ or that enough people know my theory so that a multitude of youtube videos are made where, in a sentence or two, the presenter goes off-topic and mentions why we exist / something from my theory. Having understood it once makes it impossible to forget â€“ having understood it once makes group-bonding over religion (which fuels ISIS/the taliban/etc) impossible. If the world could just take 20 minutes of itsÂ´ time to spend on explaining/teaching/arguing my work/theory, then the war on terror would be over â€“ otherwise it will persist as long as people have no actual, logical theory about their existence and thus believe in bronze-age marketing tricks.
â€”â€”-
The theory of evolution begins with the first reproducing shape. It was a shape that assembled surrounding mass into a similar shape. The existential theory predicts the existence of infinitely many such shapes. What inevitable becomes true when you have reproduction is that some die and some survive (life and death), that the number of offspring that shape make matters and that there is mutations over time. This is true about the shapeÂ´s offspring: some will die and some will survive, the number of offspring they make matters and the offspring can be different from the original shape. These three rules / laws of nature were inactive before the first reproduction occurred. The next main event was that one of these shapes found that if it injected its DNA into other shapesÂ´ reproductive mechanism, it exploited principle number two: that the number of offspring matters. It was the first virus: it hijacked othersÂ´ reproduction. The rule / law of nature that came into play with this event was that â€œpowerâ€ matters: hijacking othersÂ´ reproductive mechanism gives evolutionary benefits. Now weÂ´ve listed the four main rules that govern evolutionary theory: first came the three first, and then came the forth: power. The next main event â€“ to guard against viruses taking over all life / reproductive mechanisms â€“ was that an immune system evolved to protect against virusÂ´ hijack attempts. This required multicellularism. Just like immune systems prompt/require multicellularism, immune systems prompt/require multigenderedism: to win in the arms race against quickly mutating viruses two genders arose to amplify the mutations to the immune system. Mixing genes from two genders creates a more mutated immune system, which can keep ahead in the arms race against quickly-mutating viruses â€œtryingâ€ to mutate to bypass any immune system. The next main event is that one of these multicellular organisms â€“ a fish or worm â€“ of the male gender mutated to be agressive and defeat other males in battle. He wouldÂ´ve gotten access to many more females than his non-agressive counter-parts. This too can be called â€œpowerâ€ because the agressive male hijacks other maleÂ´s access to females by killing the males. This prompts the dinosaurs because larger muscle mass and shaper weaponry is better at killing off competitors. Amongst the dinosaurs there was the mother-offspring bond, placed there by evolution for the evolutionary benefits a mother gets from seeing an offspring survive to adulthood. This bond mutated to involve flock-members because a group working together out-competes any individualists when fighting over anything. The next main event was that someone mapped the flock, in his brain, as a hierarchy (up-down-axis) with the longing to dominate peers.

Dude, evolution has me try to maximize evolutionary benefits using my plans; im always thinking at full speed and pain drives that thinking. And i know for certain that all this pain is meaningless. Its a suicide recipe but what prevents me from suicide is the natural strength that stems from being the pinnacle of beasts who all have survived for generations.

New book 2017
Chapter 1:
What problem does this solve?
This solves a problem that becomes most visible 60 years from now when sea-levels rise, the economy goes into permanent decline and oil ends. ThatÂ´s when humans start to fight (and belong in world-view-based groups to do so). While the economy is still rising the clashes are few and far between â€“ Afghanistan, Syria, ISISÂ´ world-wide terror attacks (mainly muslim world-views clashing with tolerant world-views). When the economy starts declining thereÂ´ll naturally be more friction between groups, and groups are made up of world-views (people identify as in a group based on world-view).
Advancing the scientific world-view to the level where it explains our origin and thus invades religious intellectual turf, solves the problem of world-views colliding as war.
Chapter 2:
Certain truth â€“ I think & I am
You have a composite certain truth consisting of two certain truths: you can claim as certain that you think (because if you were being fooled: being fooled is thinking) and that you exist (because being fooled requires the one who is fooled to be there). I think and I exist is one statement but two truths. You can certainly claim to have â€œdistinctionâ€ because youÂ´re dealing with multiple separate distinct entities (such as â€œIâ€ and â€œthoughtâ€). One could put it, while seeing the certain truths â€œI thinkâ€ and â€œI existâ€, that the space between the two notions (thinker and thought) is the hallmark of distinction. The distance separating thinker from thought we can recognize as necessary for â€œdistinctionâ€ to be concluded as a certain truth arising, in a next logical step, from the original primary certain truth.
Everyone agrees they they themselves exist, because if one would get fooled in everyone one can be fooled in then one would exist there anyway and be fooled. So one knows that one exists. Then one also knows that one thinks because â€œto get fooledâ€ is a thought-process. Thus we have two things: I think and I exist. And the distinction between them: and on the flipside of the paper we have the opposite of that: anti-distinction, and this can also be called â€œthat of which all is partâ€/Reality. And since we are in the distinction-side of the paper when we see something; when we see something there is distinction between us and that thing. Thus we cannot represent or see that which is on the other side of the paper i.e. that of which all is part / Reality. Nothing can represent â€“ because it is distinct â€“ Reality. So whatever which is distinct cannotâ€¦ whatever that is observed or represented is distinct and therefore is notâ€¦ therefore does not represent Reality / â€œthat of which all is partâ€. So we have distinction and anti-distinction as opposing poles.
You have a certain truth which everyone in the whole world agrees upon. You think and you exist since if you were being fooled by an almighty demon youÂ´d still both think and exist. Then there are two things i.e. distinction. All is part of a single reality which is anti-distinction, there are no separate parts: reality is one. If we put distinction on the left side of the paper and anti-distinction on the right side then (we) distinction cannot see that of which all is part because â€œto seeâ€ is â€œto representâ€ and then one uses something to refer to reality. There is nothing outside reality which can refer to reality but instead reality is defined as â€œthat of which all is partâ€ and then there is nothing that can refer to all of reality. The opposition between the two sides of the paper (distinction & anti-distinction) makes reality as â€œthat of which all is partâ€-anti-distinction non-representable because representation always involves distinction. What we see, for example, is just parts of reality. The hypotheses can be infinitely much so there is infinitely much to reality. Sizes and times, that is. In the existential theory (â€œwhy we existâ€) there, thus, is an infinite size-range with time, energymass in spacetime (everything and nothing intertwined like in the E=mc2 equation â€“ energy equals mass times, well â€“ spacetime; multiplication is what unites energymass with spacetime). Then we have distinction and anti-distinction: separate things but all is part of a single reality. The existential theory with its three pillars, that is an infinite sizerange, energymasspacetime and distinction-anti-distinction-opposition, predicts that there should be a tiny piece of DNA which copies itself.
Then thereÂ´s another kind of revelation that got respect. Descartes who lived in the 1600s got respect, fame and was invited to live with the Queen of Sweden because he had gotten an idea which certainly told us something true. Revelations can either be con menÂ´s statements like they were from ape-man and forward, or they can actually claim something which is verifyably true. Descartes, propably having his mind overcrowded by the masses of revelations that had accumulated to his time, asked: â€œwhat would be true if all my statements were false?â€. What would remain if I tossed all my knowledge and ideas into the trash? Are we stuck with countless unverifyable statements, some contradicting eachother, not knowing which ones are true and which ones are not? Obviously not since statements about architecture are obviously true since they build houses, while contradictory statements do not. So Descartes dared to throw all his knowledge in the trash to see what remained. He found certain truth: that he exists â€“ because even if he was wrong or was being fooled in everything he thought to be true, thereÂ´d still be a â€œheâ€ there. He certainly exists no matter what. Same thing goes for thoughts: being wrong or being fooled is a thinking-process so even if he was wrong or was being fooled in everything he thought, thereÂ´d still be thought.
Socrates: So he figured out that he thinks and he exists.
God: These are not one statement â€“ they are two.
Socrates: What does that mean?
God: IÂ´ll tell you later â€“ just agree with me that there is distinction between thinker and thought â€“ that the statements are two. ItÂ´s building on certain truth, and itÂ´s possible to build a wholeâ€¦ whatever it is that â€œsaves the worldâ€ from the coming economic decline by having everyone build on certain truth until the God-debate is settled. Remembering â€œdistinctionâ€ (between thinker and thought) will prevent the horror-scenario of large-scale future wars between people group-bound by religions, and instead â€“ since everyone built a whole world-view on certain truth â€“ have a more stable decline in the future. â€œDistinctionâ€ i.e. remembering that there are two certain truths (thinker and thought) is a step on the way toward a plan that will save humanity from destroying itself as much as it would if we didnÂ´t build our world-views on certain truth.
Plato: So after an era of â€œrevelationâ€-revelations invented by anyone for whatever purpose, coming from DarwinÂ´s ape-manÂ´s revelations, Descartes, in the 1600s, invented a revelation â€“ certain truth: I think and I exist â€“ which got him invited to the Queen of Sweden for the rest of his life. People have always liked revelations and even verifyable truth-claims like DescartesÂ´ get respect.
God: I have set it as true that each one of you humans can verify in your own mindÂ´s eye that you do certainly exist and that there certainly is thought â€“ and thus there is distinction.
Darwin: Distinction is an abstract word. That two objects are separate/different from one another is one of those notions and ape-man never made into language â€“ there was never the evolutionary need to talk about â€œdistinctionâ€. Yes: one could say that one banana is different from another (and one wants the bigger one), but to have Distinction exist stand-alone as a distinct notion is abstract thinking and we are not evolved to do that. For millions of years the caveman word for â€œdistinctionâ€ was only used in a sentance â€“ not stand-alone as in â€œdistinction certainly exists because thinker and thought are both certain truthsâ€.
Chapter 3:
Distinction-antidistinction-opposition
The first proof for that the size-time-diagram is infinite is distinctionÂ´s (our) inability to see/represent anti-distinction.
Chapter 4:
Maximum size?
The second prooof for that the size-time-diagram is infinite is that if we imagine a partless anti-distinction then it has no distinction as in a â€œmaximumâ€ or â€œminimumâ€ size, i.e. the size-range is infinite.
Chapter 5:
Infinite size-time-diagram
Chapter 6:
Existential theoryÂ´s 3 pillars

Everyone agrees on that reality is one. Because itÂ´s one nothing can represent it, because the representer too should be part of reality. That means that there is a size-time-diagram which is infinite. And thatÂ´s why we exist. Everyone agrees on this eventhough we are distinct unique individuals. We have this world-view incommon, with extraterrestrials too.

Previous atheists have moved God from a place where do intervenes in everyday life using miracles, to a God that set everything in motion but then doesnÂ´t intervene. My philosophy places God as a bum who watches a skyscraper get built â€“ the bum then gets praised for the skyscraper getting built even though the bum didnÂ´t contribute anything: at most he watched as other mechanisms got everything done.
Or God is a football fan who cheers at the players but doesnÂ´t himself contribute to making goals. Natural mechanisms create the world â€“ no need to praise God.
You know for certain that you think and that you exist because even if an almighty demon was fooling you in everything you can possibly be fooled in, the fooling itself is a thought-process and therefore you know that thought exists (you think), and for you to be fooled you have to exist and therefore you know "I exist". Being fooled is thinking and a thinker is necessary for there to be someone to be fooled. So you know: no matter what, you think and you exist. Those are two things, right? TheyÂ´re both part of the same brain and the thought-process can become the analytical toolkit/thinker, but still we recognize that there are distinct entities - there is distinction. This can also be called separation. What is distinctionÂ´s opposite, anti-distinction? ItÂ´s one reality; that of which all is part; itÂ´s one and realityÂ´s definition in the dictionary is that all is part of it. If we write distinction (thinker and thought) on the left side of the paper and anti-distinction (reality; that of which all is part; one) on the right side of the paper - can the left side see the right side? No, because of opposition between distinction and anti-distinction. Because of there always being an observer (a thinker) and thus distinction in every observation and thus anti-distinction canÂ´t be represented/seen.
The brain evolved to deal with natural occurances - there was never an event in history where something invisible was to be contemplated and dealt with. Thus we seem to assume that the thought-process went wrong when we say that distinction/us canÂ´t see anti-distinction/reality. But the thought-process didnÂ´t go wrong: all that it means is that there is more to reality than can be represented. Regardless of how vaguely "represents" is defined, say a coffee cup - regardless of brains being involved - is assumed to try to represent that of which all is part, then anti-dinstinction - distinction - opposition (the opposition between distinction and itÂ´s opposite) makes the representation incorrect. We can ask if there in an anti-distinct "thing" is a maximum size and thus distinction? No. Likewise, another proof for that the size-range is infinite is that we do sense something (our everyday world) and can make hypotheses ad infinitum, and yet nothing represent
s ALL OF reality. Reality i.e. s
ize-time thus is infinite.
The infinite size-range is one pillar in the existential theory. Another pillar is energymass and spacetime being opposites but intertwined as in E=mc
2
(where c
2
refers to a speed which is space over time: spacetime). Multiplication joins energymass together with spacetime; nothing together with something/everything; existence together with non-existence. Why is there existence the shape of my body? Without going into the historical answer, one can explain it by saying that the body is something in (intertwined with) nothing, of a size in an infinite size-range (where the relationship between any two sizes (or objects of two sizes) i
s that they make sense of i.e. j
ustify one another). Then there too, as a third pillar, is distinction-
an
ti-distinction-opposition i.e. w
e live in a single (not plural) reality but we see distinct/separate entities such as thinker and thought.
Speaking of spacetime, spacetime is the logical starting point for the time-based existential theory.
Nothingness (empty space) needs n
o prior justification nor reason to exist, because it doesnÂ´t exist. In it, however
, laws of nature are true i.e. i
t is not irrational / anti-logical, and among the many laws of nature there are those, including E=mc
2
, which mention energymass. Could energymass be "mentioned" without it existing? If yes, it would be absurd / anti-logical. Why would reality mention things that never exist? But since laws of nature are firm and because of our rule "what is mentioned must exist or must be summoned" we get, wherever (in the smallest spaces) that E=mc
2
is mentioned, existence and thus dense existence: a big bang. The fact that galaxies are speeding away acceleratingly from one another leads to nothingness in the future, and with the middleman "laws of nature" again energymass is summoned as dense as can be. No time-delay between nothingness - laws of nature - energymass but as soon as a bordered (by event horizons which are determined by the finite speed of light) region becomes nothingness, a big bang occurs and eventually becomes nothingness bordered by event horizons again. This is the time-wise description of why energymass (which exists intertwined with spacetime as in E=mc
2
) starts dense and becomes nothingness, and repeats.
All of the above is a rival theory to "God created earth in 6 days and rested on the 7th". It is unintuitive because it deals with things we didnÂ´t have to deal with in evolution: invisible energymasspacetime/reality/anti-distinction as a part of reasoning. It also has a multi-reason cause for our existence: a time-wise rationale involving the beginning and end of the big bang combined with a 3-pillar existential theory which justifies size and energymass. It is abstract/scientific but canÂ´t be reduced into simpler terms. ItÂ´s the lowest common denominator that everyone can believe in (regardless of religion).
How many is reality? One. How many is Allah? One. Can anything completely represent reality? No. Can anything completely represent Allah? No. Is reality the greatest (if all is part of it)? Yes. Is â€œAllah akbarâ€? Yes. Reality and Allah have these three things incommon â€“ so maybe reality is synonymous with Allah?
How vaguely has reality defined â€to representâ€?
Infinitely vaguely â€“ anything can represent anything.
Is the representation/representer reality or Allah?
No.
Can anything represent that of which all is part?
No.
Then the size-time-diagram is infinite i.e. nothing represents reality. How many is it? How many is Allah? 1.
Did it sayâ€¦, or did it wri
te a book?
This disproves Allah writing the Quran.
Again: how much of reality can be represented by, say, a painting? The whole of it?
No, the whole of reality cannot be represented. Just like Allah canÂ´t be captured in a picture/word.
We can have hypotheses â€“ how many hypotheses can we have?
If reality is sizes & times, energymass and spacetime then the square-shaped size-time-diagram with energymasspacetime in each coordinate is the universal way to represent all there is to represent.
Does it write books? No, it is not of such authorship-kind nature.
â€œGod said to Muhammed word by wordâ€¦â€ is thus a false or at most metaphorical statement.
â€œYou have to do rituals in order not to go to hell, and in heaven you get 72 virginsâ€ is by the same logic also a false claim.
There are three alternatives as the foundation for this logic â€“ can you think of a 4
th
one?
1: Reality is a synonym for Allah
2: or Allah doesnÂ´t exist
3: or there are 72 virgins (not an alternative because reality is not of the nature, because it is size-time-energymasspacetime, to write books).
In addition to the square size-time diagram with infinity symbols in each of itÂ´s corners, and the evolutionary triangle which designates that life becomes more complex as time goes on
(the triangle originates at the central size of the known size-range), there is the following brain diagram:
You have a composite certain truth consisting of two certain truths: you can claim as certain that you think (because if you were being fooled: being fooled is thinking) and that you exist (because being fooled requires the one who is fooled to be there). I think and I exist is one statement but two truths. You can certainly claim to have â€œdistinctionâ€ because youÂ´re dealing
with multiple separate distinct entities (such as â€œIâ€ and â€œthoughtâ€). One could put it, while seeing the certain truths â€œI thinkâ€ and â€œI existâ€, that the space between the two notions (thinker and thought) is the hallmark of distinction. The distance separating thinker from thought we can recognize as necessary for â€œdistinctionâ€ to be concluded as a certain truth arising, in a next logical step, from the original primary certain truth.
Are all distinct entities part of a single reality if â€œrealityâ€ is defined as â€œthat of which all is partâ€? In other words: if we draw distinction on the left side of a paper and anti-distinction (distinctionÂ´s opposite: a singular reality â€“ that of which all is part. Zooming out summarizing maximally) on the right side of the paper, then can distinction represent the right side of the paper i.e. anti-distinction? How could some distinct entities depict the very opposite of what representation/distinction is? Any depiction/representation of anti-distinction/reality has at least three entities: thinker, space between thinker and thought, and thought. Separation/distinction is inherent in representation, thus anti-distinction is unrepresentable.
How vaguely has the universe/God defined what a representation is i.e. when a representation occurs? Our brains use neurons to represent, but what if â€“ instead of neurons (regardless of brains) â€“ the universe wills that any random object can be said to, as neurons do, represent reality? The universe has defined â€œrepresentationâ€ infinitely vaguely i.e. disregarding brains, any random object spontaneously is the symbol standing for all of reality â€“ because the universe defines â€œrepresentsâ€ infinitely vaguely. Despite the infinitely vague definition of what represents what, distinction-anti-distinction-opposition (the line separating the left side of the paper from the right side; the countering of distinction with anti-distinction) means that reality is not representable. If reality is anti-distinction then no distinction (representation is inherently distinction) can even, despite an infinitely vague definition of â€œrepresentsâ€, capture reality.
In
representations we can count at least three things and what weÂ´re trying to capture is one thing with nothing outside it. The fact that representations contain distinction makes capturing reality (all is one) impossible.
We can have infinitely many or infinitely large/substancefull representations/hypotheses â€“ such as an infinite size-time-diagram â€“ and though abstractly accurately pointing to reality, the universeÂ´s rule that nothing represents reality despite infinitely vaguely allowed representations of infinitely much, makes reality unrepresentable. This can only mean one thing: reality â€“ which we know as sizes and times (a size-time-diagram) â€“ is infinite. ThereÂ´s infinitely large and infinitely small with infinitely much past and infinitely much future. This square-shaped size-time-diagram i.e. our everyday experience of size-time has infinities all-over the place.
Energymass in spacetime: one in zero, existence in non-existence, something in nothing â€“ as defined by E=mc
2
where c
2
stands for speed (distance over time i.e. spacetime/zero/non-existence) and E=m referring to energymass (existence, something, all).
Distinction-anti-distinction-opposition: we live in a singular reality but we see multiple objects.
An infinite size-range.
The above three ideas are an existential theory (a theory which explains the existence of a reproducing shape and thus the dawn of evolution and thus our existence). It is modern to utilize three equal ideas to explain oneÂ´s existence â€“ all previous existential theories used either a single idea (monotheism) or a saga (multiple mundane (not very scientific/abstract) ideas) to explain existence.
The predictive quality that makes this existential theory a scientific theory is that it, basing it off an infinite size-range of energymasspacetime and distinction-anti-distinction-opposition, predicts that in an infinite size-range there ought to be a size where reproduction occurs. The existential theory predicts the first DNA, and from there we get to the evolutionary theory.
Another predictive quality is that the theory predicts a
dense
Big Bang. The a priori beginning of the universe logically is emptiness because emptiness doesnÂ´t need any prior logical justification for its existence because it doesnÂ´t exist. In emptiness laws of nature are true, such as the laws pointing toward and handleing energymass (like E=mc
2
), and thus the Big Bang begins infinitely dense because E=mc
2
is equally true simultaneously in the smallest of spaces. Tiny empty spaces having E=mc
2
be true in them simultaneously and directly as there was nothingness predicts a dense Big Bang. A region, contained within event horizons made out of energymasses speeding away at >c (due to dark energy causing accelerating cosmic expansion), is by definition â€œnothingâ€ in which E=mc
2
being true in the tiniest spaces summons a dense big bang out of reach of the closest (v = >c) energymass. Nothingness (out of reach for the closest energymasses because they are speeding away at >c) is summoned in the central point with event horizons as the furthest away border, causing Big Bang (due to laws of nature summoning energymass in the empty center).
The theory of evolution begins with the first reproducing shape. It was a shape that assembled surrounding mass into a similar shape. The existential theory predicts the existence of infinitely many such shapes. What inevitable becomes true when you have reproduction is that some die and some survive (life and death), that the number of offspring that shape make matters and that there is mutations over time. This is true about the shapeÂ´s offspring: some will die and some will survive, the number of offspring they make matters and the offspring can be different from the original shape. These three rules / laws of nature were inactive before the first reproduction occurred. The next main event was that one of these shapes found that if it injected its DNA into other shapesÂ´ reproductive mechanism, it exploited principle number two: that the number of offspring matters. It was the first virus: it hijacked othersÂ´ reproduction. The rule / law of nature that came into play with this event was that "power" matters: hijacking othersÂ´ reproductive mechanism gives evolutionary benefits. Now weÂ´ve listed the four main rules that govern evolutionary theory: first came the three first, and then came the forth: power. The next main event - to guard against viruses taking over all life / reproductive mechanisms - was that an immune system evolved to protect against virusÂ´ hijack attempts. This required multicellularism. Just like immune systems prompt/require multicellularism, immune systems prompt/require multigenderedism: to win in the arms race against quickly mutating viruses two genders arose to amplify the mutations to the immune system. Mixing genes from two genders creates a more mutated immune system, which can keep ahead in the arms race against quickly-mutating viruses "trying" to mutate to bypass any immune system. The next main event is that one of these multicellular organisms - a fish or worm - of the male gender mutated to be ag
g
ressive and defeat other males in battle. He wouldÂ´ve gotten access to many more females than his non-ag
g
ressive counter-parts. This too can be called "power" because the ag
g
ressive male hijacks other maleÂ´s access to females by killing the males. This prompts the dinosaurs because larger muscle mass and shaper weaponry is better at killing off competitors. Amongst the dinosaurs there was the mother-offspring bond, placed there by evolution for the evolutionary benefits a mother gets from seeing an offspring survive to adulthood. This bond mutated to involve flock-members because a group working together out-competes any individualists when fighting over anything. The next main event was that someone mapped the flock, in his brain, as a hierarchy (up-down-axis) with the longing to
be the top of the hierarchy. This capitalist striving for
the top made brains grew larger
â€“ larger memory-banks, more accurate predictions and faster planning are all advantages coming from a larger cortex.
It is a major historical event that there finally is an atheistic argument that is sh
aped like a university course: i
t is an existential theory plus evolution which not only doesnÂ´t need a personified god to function, but the pillars (infinite sizerange of energymasspacetime and distinction-anti-distinction-opposition) canÂ´t have a personified god added to them as a 4th pillar without the theory sounding ridicilous. Not only does the theory not need a personified god but adding a god destroys the minimalistic rationally complete beauty of the theory. Gods uglify the theory. The dawn of the theory is a major historical event because never before has an entire course (beginning with certain truth, going through the existential theory and ending in evolution) been laid out in the intellectual debate of atheism, as an argument against a personified god.
The anatomy in the brain from hearing certain truth (I think & I am) - the beginning of the course - creates the same neuronal pathways / associations between ideas in every single person who knows certain truth. The logical step to "distinction" is noting, as a meta-analysis of the primary certain truth, that one has many ideas (I think AND I am) and that one can take logical pathways to the next step in the course (distinction exists). Then juxtaposing anti-distinction with distinction creates the unseeable - "defying reason" (because reason is, in simple people, only visual) - conclusion that we/distinction cannot see reality/anti-distinction. The distinction-anti-distinction-opposition is hard to grasp because it - like formal logic or math - uses words instead of pictures (the linguistic brainhalf rather than the visual one). We evolved to be like "if I see it I believe it" and that was a good heuristic (rule of thumb) because practical sequences of events can be verified as true or untrue by visualizing them. But in this philosophy: no - it has to be linguistic that we deny ourselves the concept "all of reality", leading to the conclusion that there is more to reality than anything - however vaguely the universe has defined "represent" - can represent. This adds infinitely many sizes to our abstract size-range / size-time-diagram; it makes a square (with size on the y-axis and time on the x-axis) with infinity symbols in each corner, which in turn becomes a pillar in our personified-god-denying existential theory.
To come from certain truth, through mere logical steps (meta-analyses and juxtaposition of opposites), to an existential theory which predicts evolution is a major historical event in the history of atheism.
In a historical context the anatomy (neural connections between ideas and sequences of logic) created by this course is like a paradigm-shift into a new era of earth society - an era similar to that existent on infinitely many other planets who have come further than our midway-mark in a regular water-bearing planetÂ´s history.
Evolution, by beginning with "a mass that can assemble surrounding mass into a similar shape" steps forth from the existential theoryÂ´s infinite size-range of energymasspacetime. Assuming DNA is the replication-molecule, we can step - skipping over how cell walls evolved etc - to the fact that viruses mutate to hijack othersÂ´ reproductive system. This - in this universal inter-planetary extraterrestrial culture - is formulated, in books of logic, as first three rules arising (life/death, number of offspring matters and "there is mutation in each generation-shift") and then a forth rule arising (power, with viruses). This story - which in our course begins from a first reproducing shape and ends with finessing the anatomy of power in men - is visualizable like the caveman story-telling narratives we evolved to hear/see. We can proof-check its validity/possibility by following the narrative visually. The visual nature of evolution is in stark contrast to the purely linguistic/abstract nature of the existential theory.
Speaking o
f "abstract" descriptions i.e. d
escriptions that make it very clear to us that our understanding of the universe is a mere map (a reference) and not reality itself (mind you of PlatoÂ´s or KantÂ´s cave-metaphor and "the thing is not the thing itself" -philosophies)... The size-range of energymasspacetime,
at the size of quantum physics
has us describe photons etc using both the wave-description which focu
s
es on lengths of space (this is the "spacetime description") AND - in wave-particle duality - the energymass description that the energy of a photon is its color. Color (as perceived through the eyes), wave/spacetime-description and particle-energy/energymass-description all are valid descriptors of quantum particles. This ability of ours to describe any mass/phenomenon using both energymass- and spacetime-descriptions runs throughout the entire size-range. You can imagine two lines - one representing energymass and the other representing spacetime - running vertically through the pictures on the size-axis. Adding complexity to this, there is likewise two lines - gravity and electromagnetism - both running through the size-axis, gravity having itÂ´s duality of energymass and spacetime descriptions and electromagnetism too having both, in every level of the size-range, energymass and spacetime descriptions. Gravity is both Newtonian "masses pulling toward masses" (energymassÂ´ focus on mass) and Einsteinian "curvature of spacetime" (spacetimeÂ´s focus on space) - both descriptors are accurate.
We are half-way in a planetÂ´s history â€“ 4.5 billion years have passed and 5 billion remain. The theory you now know is, in other words, in cosmic majority â€“ more planets have it than not (if it takes approximately half of a planetÂ´s history to invent it and if it remains true for the rest of the planetÂ´s history). Most other planets i.e. the majority of extraterrestrials are ideological adherents of the theory. Spread this theory to get approval of the majority even though it lives light-years away. Currently 99.9% of the worldÂ´s population lives in the era of religions â€“ spread this theory to end religious wars and terrorism like 9/11. The world-view (the view/diagrams that explain the world) is the same in the cosmic majority.
IÂ´ve worked 10 years to invent this theory and as alone bearing it itÂ´s my responsibility that it spreads. The future civilization in which everyone has the same world-view thus is dependent on me. I feel a
unique ability to influence earthÂ´s future.
You, as one who has partaken of this rare knowledge, should also feel a responsibility about spreading it to change the world.
IÂ´ve talked about the emotional repertoire in the brain-diagram. If we were to genetically engineer (DNA-manipulate) a next generation, we would A) give it an incredible sense of humor and knowledge so it could entertain us, and/or B) make it a super-happy retard â€“ retarded because positive emotions donÂ´t motivate â€“ they pacify â€“ so super-happy is equal to looking like a mongoloid; needs and wants and everything that drives us is painful â€“ pain motivates while super-happiness pacifies. We would, by creating these DNA-engineered emotional repertoires (to accomplish the dual goal of incredible happiness and incredible entertainers/comedians/philosophers), be doing something that is done on other planets â€“ these are universal engineering goals. I need money to accomplish this project. If you wish to contribute, contact yonis1@gmail.com
You know that gold plate we sent up into space for aliens to find? It had etched on it images of man, some music, some other picturesâ€¦ We didnÂ´t send up the diagram discussed in this book. If the aliens see the gold plate we did send up, theyÂ´ll read between the lines â€“ seeing that there is no universal diagram â€“ and conclude that: â€œon earth they still believe in godsâ€.
You know how most people dedicate a large part of their lives to religion? Once they understand my tattoo (diagram) theyÂ´ll ask themselves: â€œwhat the hell have I been praying to?â€ It resembles a tiny needle popping a big balloon.
If this book goes mainstream, the future becomes so interesting that one forgets oneÂ´s everyday problems.
Interesting important things relieve
anxiety
(especially when they contain humor like a universal tattoo).
Nazis were friends with Nazis, communists were friends with communists, USA was friends with USA, when jihadists meet they share the same ideology and thus bond quickly. My
theory/ideology/religion-replacer is empathy-increasing.
The more things people agree upon the better.
In the diagram/tattoo there are about 16 â€œlinesâ€ (hundreds if we consider the emotional repertoire being drawn the same on other planets). The sport is to draw as many universal lines as possible â€“ drawn from science so they can be drawn from science anywhere in the infinite universe.
God is a war-motivator. They say â€œthere are no atheists in trenchholesâ€. You need a bit of God to do war.
ItÂ´s hard to be an atheist warrior. My book, by disproving god, thus makes motivation for war less.
Gods contribute nothing â€“ one will have the full human experience-repertoire without gods.
Rather no direction than the wrong direction â€“ gods only contribute to war; itÂ´s better to be tolerantly caveman, uncaring of ideologies/world-views, than to be religious.
It seems mean to say that â€œitÂ´s their fault that religious wars keep on going â€“ those that wonÂ´t studyâ€, but itÂ´s good marketing.
Accomplices.
From having read this book, the following should now be understandable:
Certain truth leads to the conclusion â€œdistinctionâ€, and simultaneously warrants an anti-distinction defined as â€œthat of which all is partâ€. The opposition between distinction and anti-distinction â€“ despite â€œrepresentationâ€ being ubiquitous (infinitely vaguely defined) â€“ together with the â€œmax size?â€-question asked in anti-distinction â€“ supports the fact that reality i.e. size-time is infinite. This then becomes our pillar in our existential theory that moves God away from a creator role. The two other pillars are energimasspacetime (found in E=mc
2
) and the opposition that we live in a singular reality yet see multiple things. From the middle of the known size-range (which itself is part of the infinite size-range) comes the tip of a triangle which symbolizes evolution. From evolution, then, comes the brain diagram with dopamine & serotonin across the visual and linguistic brainhalves, and a lower box which is our 3-category emotional repertoire; the most common 4 emotions in our idle society being power-hungryness (how to elevate oneself in the socioeconomic hierarchy if one is a man; and for females itÂ´s mapping the status-hierarchy of men in their social group as to find them differently attractive), expanding oneÂ´s world-view, planning sex and planning resource-gathering/work.
This makes for a multi-symbol diagram involving the existential theoryÂ´s three pillars holding up the square-triangle-brain (size-time-diagram, evolution, brain) diagram.
Certain truth is or leads to distinction, which itself â€“ as all distinct things are â€“ is part of anti-distinction.
This is like saying obvious things about the reality/everyday world in front of us: such as that size is infinite and that it is something in nothing. All this, in turn, leads us to draw a square: a size-time diagram with infinity-symbols in all 4 corners. From the middle of the known size-range,
then, comes a triangle â€“ evolution â€“ which ends up in the brain with serotonine, dopamine, two brainhalves, a cortex and an emotional repertoire (upper- and lower box). In the emotional repertoire there are 4 idle emotions, among them â€œseeking powerâ€ â€“ power here is defined as outcompeting other males (if oneself is male) in a status competition, but the principle of diminishing other malesÂ´ reproductive capabilities happened at several stages in evolution: males fighting males (growing bigger to become dinosaurs) or viruses hijacking reproductive mechanisms of single-celled organisms.
The search for power thus has led to brain-size growing (when competing for upwardness in hierarchies) but also things like T-rexÂ´s claws or the 1918 flu â€“ not to mention war.

Important Semi-Book 2017
The text begins with certain truth, goes on to explaining why something exists rather than nothing (the existential theory â€“ why we exist), and then goes on to evolutionary theory which is predicted by the existential theory and explains everday occurances.
You know for certain that you think and that you exist because even if an almighty demon was fooling you in everything you can possibly be fooled in, the fooling itself is a thought-process and therefore you know that thought exists (you think), and for you to be fooled you have to exist and therefore you know â€œI existâ€. Being fooled is thinking and a thinker is necessary for there to be someone to be fooled. So you know: no matter what, you think and you exist. Those are two things, right? TheyÂ´re both part of the same brain and the thought-process can become the analytical toolkit/thinker, but still we recognize that there are distinct entities â€“ there is distinction. This can also be called separation. What is distinctionÂ´s opposite, anti-distinction? ItÂ´s one reality; that of which all is part; itÂ´s one and realityÂ´s definition in the dictionary is that all is part of it. If we write distinction (thinker and thought) on the left side of the paper and anti-distinction (reality; that of which all is part; one) on the right side of the paper â€“ can the left side see the right side? No, because of opposition between distinction and anti-distinction. Because of there always being an observer (a thinker) and thus distinction in every observation and thus anti-distinction canÂ´t be represented/seen.
The brain evolved to deal with natural occurances â€“ there was never an event in history where something invisible was to be contemplated and dealt with. Thus we seem to assume that the thought-process went wrong when we say that distinction/us canÂ´t see anti-distinction/reality. But the thought-process didnÂ´t go wrong: all that it means is that there is more to reality than can be represented. Regardless of how vaguely â€œrepresentsâ€ is defined, say a coffee cup â€“ regardless of brains being involved â€“ is assumed to try to represent that of which all is part, then anti-dinstinction â€“ distinction â€“ opposition (the opposition between distinction and itÂ´s opposite) makes the representation incorrect. We can ask if there in an anti-distinct â€œthingâ€ is a maximum size and thus distinction? No. Likewise, another proof for that the size-range is infinite is that we do sense something (our everyday world) and can make hypotheses ad infinitum, and yet nothing represents ALL OF reality. Reality i.e. size-time thus is infinite.
The infinite size-range is one pillar in the existential theory. Another pillar is energymass and spacetime being opposites but intertwined as in E=mc
2
(where c
2
refers to a speed which is space over time: spacetime). Multiplication joins energymass together with spacetime; nothing together with something/everything; existence together with non-existence. Why is there existence the shape of my body? Without going into the historical answer, one can explain it by saying that the body is something in (intertwined with) nothing, of a size in an infinite size-range (where the relationship between any two sizes (or objects of two sizes) is that they make sense of i.e. justify one another). Then there too, as a third pillar, is distinction-anti-distinction-opposition i.e. we live in a single (not plural) reality but we see distinct/separate entities such as thinker and thought.
Speaking of spacetime, spacetime is the logical starting point for the time-based existential theory. Nothingness (empty space) needs no prior justification nor reason to exist, because it doesnÂ´t exist. In it, however, laws of nature are true i.e. it is not irrational / anti-logical, and among the many laws of nature there are those, including E=mc
2
, which mention energymass. Could energymass be â€œmentionedâ€ without it existing? If yes, it would be absurd / anti-logical. Why would reality mention things that never exist? But since laws of nature are firm and because of our rule â€œwhat is mentioned must exist or must be summonedâ€ we get, wherever (in the smallest spaces) that E=mc
2
is mentioned, existence and thus dense existence: a big bang. The fact that galaxies are speeding away acceleratingly from one another leads to nothingness in the future, and with the middleman â€œlaws of natureâ€ again energymass is summoned as dense as can be. No time-delay between nothingness â€“ laws of nature â€“ energymass but as soon as a bordered (by event horizons which are determined by the finite speed of light) region becomes nothingness, a big bang occurs and eventually becomes nothingness bordered by event horizons again. This is the time-wise description of why energymass (which exists intertwined with spacetime as in E=mc
2
) starts dense and becomes nothingness, and repeats.
All of the above is a rival theory to â€œGod created earth in 6 days and rested on the 7thâ€. It is unintuitive because it deals with things we didnÂ´t have to deal with in evolution: invisible energymasspacetime/reality/anti-distinction as a part of reasoning. It also has a multi-reason cause for our existence: a time-wise rationale involving the beginning and end of the big bang combined with a 3-pillar existential theory which justifies size and energymass. It is abstract/scientific but canÂ´t be reduced into simpler terms. ItÂ´s the lowest common denominator that everyone can believe in (regardless of religion).
How vaguely has reality defined â€to representâ€?
Infinitely vaguely â€“ anything can represent anything.
Is the representation/representer reality or Allah?
No.
Can anything represent that of which all is part?
No.
Then the size-time-diagram is infinite i.e. nothing represents reality. How many is it? How many is Allah? 1.
Did it sayâ€¦, or did it write a book?
This disproves Allah writing the Quran.
Again: how much of reality can be represented by, say, a painting? The whole of it?
No, the whole of reality cannot be represented. Just like Allah canÂ´t be captured in a picture/word.
We can have hypotheses â€“ how many hypotheses can we have?
If reality is sizes & times, energymass and spacetime then the square-shaped size-time-diagram with energymasspacetime in each coordinate is the universal way to represent all there is to represent.
Does it write books? No, it is not of such authorship-kind nature.
â€œGod said to Muhammed word by wordâ€¦â€ is thus a false or at most metaphorical statement.
â€œYou have to do rituals in order not to go to hell, and in heaven you get 72 virginsâ€ is by the same logic also a false claim.
There are three alternatives as the foundation for this logic â€“ can you think of a 4
th
one?
1: Reality is a synonym for Allah
2: or Allah doesnÂ´t exist
3: or there are 72 virgins (not an alternative because reality is not of the nature, because it is size-time-energymasspacetime, to write books).
In addition to the square size-time diagram with infinity symbols in each of itÂ´s corners, and the evolutionary triangle which designates that life becomes more complex as time goes on (the triangle originates at the central size of the known size-range), there is the following brain diagram:
You have a composite certain truth consisting of two certain truths: you can claim as certain that you think (because if you were being fooled: being fooled is thinking) and that you exist (because being fooled requires the one who is fooled to be there). I think and I exist is one statement but two truths. You can certainly claim to have â€œdistinctionâ€ because youÂ´re dealing with multiple separate distinct entities (such as â€œIâ€ and â€œthoughtâ€). One could put it, while seeing the certain truths â€œI thinkâ€ and â€œI existâ€, that the space between the two notions (thinker and thought) is the hallmark of distinction. The distance separating thinker from thought we can recognize as necessary for â€œdistinctionâ€ to be concluded as a certain truth arising, in a next logical step, from the original primary certain truth.
Are all distinct entities part of a single reality if â€œrealityâ€ is defined as â€œthat of which all is partâ€? In other words: if we draw distinction on the left side of a paper and anti-distinction (distinctionÂ´s opposite: a singular reality â€“ that of which all is part. Zooming out summarizing maximally) on the right side of the paper, then can distinction represent the right side of the paper i.e. anti-distinction? How could some distinct entities depict the very opposite of what representation/distinction is? Any depiction/representation of anti-distinction/reality has at least three entities: thinker, space between thinker and thought, and thought. Separation/distinction is inherent in representation, thus anti-distinction is unrepresentable.
How vaguely has the universe/God defined what a representation is i.e. when a representation occurs? Our brains use neurons to represent, but what if â€“ instead of neurons (regardless of brains) â€“ the universe wills that any random object can be said to, as neurons do, represent reality? The universe has defined â€œrepresentationâ€ infinitely vaguely i.e. disregarding brains, any random object spontaneously is the symbol standing for all of reality â€“ because the universe defines â€œrepresentsâ€ infinitely vaguely. Despite the infinitely vague definition of what represents what, distinction-anti-distinction-opposition (the line separating the left side of the paper from the right side; the countering of distinction with anti-distinction) means that reality is not representable. If reality is anti-distinction then no distinction (representation is inherently distinction) can even, despite an infinitely vague definition of â€œrepresentsâ€, capture reality. In representations we can count at least three things and what weÂ´re trying to capture is one thing with nothing outside it. The fact that representations contain distinction makes capturing reality (all is one) impossible.
We can have infinitely many or infinitely large/substancefull representations/hypotheses â€“ such as an infinite size-time-diagram â€“ and though abstractly accurately pointing to reality, the universeÂ´s rule that nothing represents reality despite infinitely vaguely allowed representations of infinitely much, makes reality unrepresentable. This can only mean one thing: reality â€“ which we know as sizes and times (a size-time-diagram) â€“ is infinite. ThereÂ´s infinitely large and infinitely small with infinitely much past and infinitely much future. This square-shaped size-time-diagram i.e. our everyday experience of size-time has infinities all-over the place.
Energymass in spacetime: one in zero, existence in non-existence, something in nothing â€“ as defined by E=mc
2
where c
2
stands for speed (distance over time i.e. spacetime/zero/non-existence) and E=m referring to energymass (existence, something, all).
Distinction-anti-distinction-opposition: we live in a singular reality but we see multiple objects.
An infinite size-range.
The above three ideas are an existential theory (a theory which explains the existence of a reproducing shape and thus the dawn of evolution and thus our existence). It is modern to utilize three equal ideas to explain oneÂ´s existence â€“ all previous existential theories used either a single idea (monotheism) or a saga (multiple mundane (not very scientific/abstract) ideas) to explain existence.
The predictive quality that makes this existential theory a scientific theory is that it, basing it off an infinite size-range of energymasspacetime and distinction-anti-distinction-opposition, predicts that in an infinite size-range there ought to be a size where reproduction occurs. The existential theory predicts the first DNA, and from there we get to the evolutionary theory.
Another predictive quality is that the theory predicts a
dense
Big Bang. The a priori beginning of the universe logically is emptiness because emptiness doesnÂ´t need any prior logical justification for its existence because it doesnÂ´t exist. In emptiness laws of nature are true, such as the laws pointing toward and handleing energymass (like E=mc
2
), and thus the Big Bang begins infinitely dense because E=mc
2
is equally true simultaneously in the smallest of spaces. Tiny empty spaces having E=mc
2
be true in them simultaneously and directly as there was nothingness predicts a dense Big Bang. A region, contained within event horizons made out of energymasses speeding away at >c (due to dark energy causing accelerating cosmic expansion), is by definition â€œnothingâ€ in which E=mc
2
being true in the tiniest spaces summons a dense big bang out of reach of the closest (v = >c) energymass. Nothingness (out of reach for the closest energymasses because they are speeding away at >c) is summoned in the central point with event horizons as the furthest away border, causing Big Bang (due to laws of nature summoning energymass in the empty center).
The theory of evolution begins with the first reproducing shape. It was a shape that assembled surrounding mass into a similar shape. The existential theory predicts the existence of infinitely many such shapes. What inevitable becomes true when you have reproduction is that some die and some survive (life and death), that the number of offspring that shape make matters and that there is mutations over time. This is true about the shapeÂ´s offspring: some will die and some will survive, the number of offspring they make matters and the offspring can be different from the original shape. These three rules / laws of nature were inactive before the first reproduction occurred. The next main event was that one of these shapes found that if it injected its DNA into other shapesÂ´ reproductive mechanism, it exploited principle number two: that the number of offspring matters. It was the first virus: it hijacked othersÂ´ reproduction. The rule / law of nature that came into play with this event was that â€œpowerâ€ matters: hijacking othersÂ´ reproductive mechanism gives evolutionary benefits. Now weÂ´ve listed the four main rules that govern evolutionary theory: first came the three first, and then came the forth: power. The next main event â€“ to guard against viruses taking over all life / reproductive mechanisms â€“ was that an immune system evolved to protect against virusÂ´ hijack attempts. This required multicellularism. Just like immune systems prompt/require multicellularism, immune systems prompt/require multigenderedism: to win in the arms race against quickly mutating viruses two genders arose to amplify the mutations to the immune system. Mixing genes from two genders creates a more mutated immune system, which can keep ahead in the arms race against quickly-mutating viruses â€œtryingâ€ to mutate to bypass any immune system. The next main event is that one of these multicellular organisms â€“ a fish or worm â€“ of the male gender mutated to be aggressive and defeat other males in battle. He wouldÂ´ve gotten access to many more females than his non-aggressive counter-parts. This too can be called â€œpowerâ€ because the aggressive male hijacks other maleÂ´s access to females by killing the males. This prompts the dinosaurs because larger muscle mass and shaper weaponry is better at killing off competitors. Amongst the dinosaurs there was the mother-offspring bond, placed there by evolution for the evolutionary benefits a mother gets from seeing an offspring survive to adulthood. This bond mutated to involve flock-members because a group working together out-competes any individualists when fighting over anything. The next main event was that someone mapped the flock, in his brain, as a hierarchy (up-down-axis) with the longing to be the top of the hierarchy. This capitalist striving for the top made brains grew larger â€“ larger memory-banks, more accurate predictions and faster planning are all advantages coming from a larger cortex.
It is a major historical event that there finally is an atheistic argument that is shaped like a university course: it is an existential theory plus evolution which not only doesnÂ´t need a personified god to function, but the pillars (infinite sizerange of energymasspacetime and distinction-anti-distinction-opposition) canÂ´t have a personified god added to them as a 4th pillar without the theory sounding ridicilous. Not only does the theory not need a personified god but adding a god destroys the minimalistic rationally complete beauty of the theory. Gods uglify the theory. The dawn of the theory is a major historical event because never before has an entire course (beginning with certain truth, going through the existential theory and ending in evolution) been laid out in the intellectual debate of atheism, as an argument against a personified god.
The anatomy in the brain from hearing certain truth (I think & I am) â€“ the beginning of the course â€“ creates the same neuronal pathways / associations between ideas in every single person who knows certain truth. The logical step to â€œdistinctionâ€ is noting, as a meta-analysis of the primary certain truth, that one has many ideas (I think AND I am) and that one can take logical pathways to the next step in the course (distinction exists). Then juxtaposing anti-distinction with distinction creates the unseeable â€“ â€œdefying reasonâ€ (because reason is, in simple people, only visual) â€“ conclusion that we/distinction cannot see reality/anti-distinction. The distinction-anti-distinction-opposition is hard to grasp because it â€“ like formal logic or math â€“ uses words instead of pictures (the linguistic brainhalf rather than the visual one). We evolved to be like â€œif I see it I believe itâ€ and that was a good heuristic (rule of thumb) because practical sequences of events can be verified as true or untrue by visualizing them. But in this philosophy: no â€“ it has to be linguistic that we deny ourselves the concept â€œall of realityâ€, leading to the conclusion that there is more to reality than anything â€“ however vaguely the universe has defined â€œrepresentâ€ â€“ can represent. This adds infinitely many sizes to our abstract size-range / size-time-diagram; it makes a square (with size on the y-axis and time on the x-axis) with infinity symbols in each corner, which in turn becomes a pillar in our personified-god-denying existential theory.
To come from certain truth, through mere logical steps (meta-analyses and juxtaposition of opposites), to an existential theory which predicts evolution is a major historical event in the history of atheism.
In a historical context the anatomy (neural connections between ideas and sequences of logic) created by this course is like a paradigm-shift into a new era of earth society â€“ an era similar to that existent on infinitely many other planets who have come further than our midway-mark in a regular water-bearing planetÂ´s history.
Evolution, by beginning with â€œa mass that can assemble surrounding mass into a similar shapeâ€ steps forth from the existential theoryÂ´s infinite size-range of energymasspacetime. Assuming DNA is the replication-molecule, we can step â€“ skipping over how cell walls evolved etc â€“ to the fact that viruses mutate to hijack othersÂ´ reproductive system. This â€“ in this universal inter-planetary extraterrestrial culture â€“ is formulated, in books of logic, as first three rules arising (life/death, number of offspring matters and â€œthere is mutation in each generation-shiftâ€) and then a forth rule arising (power, with viruses). This story â€“ which in our course begins from a first reproducing shape and ends with finessing the anatomy of power in men â€“ is visualizable like the caveman story-telling narratives we evolved to hear/see. We can proof-check its validity/possibility by following the narrative visually. The visual nature of evolution is in stark contrast to the purely linguistic/abstract nature of the existential theory.
Speaking of â€œabstractâ€ descriptions i.e. descriptions that make it very clear to us that our understanding of the universe is a mere map (a reference) and not reality itself (mind you of PlatoÂ´s or KantÂ´s cave-metaphor and â€œthe thing is not the thing itselfâ€ -philosophies)â€¦ The size-range of energymasspacetime, at the size of quantum physics has us describe photons etc using both the wave-description which focuses on lengths of space (this is the â€œspacetime descriptionâ€) AND â€“ in wave-particle duality â€“ the energymass description that the energy of a photon is its color. Color (as perceived through the eyes), wave/spacetime-description and particle-energy/energymass-description all are valid descriptors of quantum particles. This ability of ours to describe any mass/phenomenon using both energymass- and spacetime-descriptions runs throughout the entire size-range. You can imagine two lines â€“ one representing energymass and the other representing spacetime â€“ running vertically through the pictures on the size-axis. Adding complexity to this, there is likewise two lines â€“ gravity and electromagnetism â€“ both running through the size-axis, gravity having itÂ´s duality of energymass and spacetime descriptions and electromagnetism too having both, in every level of the size-range, energymass and spacetime descriptions. Gravity is both Newtonian â€œmasses pulling toward massesâ€ (energymassÂ´ focus on mass) and Einsteinian â€œcurvature of spacetimeâ€ (spacetimeÂ´s focus on space) â€“ both descriptors are accurate.
We are half-way in a planetÂ´s history â€“ 4.5 billion years have passed and 5 billion remain. The theory you now know is, in other words, in cosmic majority â€“ more planets have it than not (if it takes approximately half of a planetÂ´s history to invent it and if it remains true for the rest of the planetÂ´s history). Most other planets i.e. the majority of extraterrestrials are ideological adherents of the theory. Spread this theory to get approval of the majority even though it lives light-years away. Currently 99.9% of the worldÂ´s population lives in the era of religions â€“ spread this theory to end religious wars and terrorism like 9/11. The world-view (the view/diagrams that explain the world) is the same in the cosmic majority.
IÂ´ve worked 10 years to invent this theory and as alone bearing it itÂ´s my responsibility that it spreads. The future civilization in which everyone has the same world-view thus is dependent on me. I feel a unique ability to influence earthÂ´s future.

Swedish important semi-book 2017
Texten bÃ¶rjar med sÃ¤ker sanning, sedan gÃ¥r den till att fÃ¶rklara varfÃ¶r nÃ¥gonting existerar istÃ¤llet fÃ¶r ingenting (den existentiella teorin â€“ varfÃ¶r vi existerar), sedan gÃ¥r den till evolutionÃ¤r teori vilket fÃ¶rutsÃ¤gs av den existentiella teorin. Den evolutionÃ¤ra teorin fÃ¶rklarar vardagsfenomen.
Du vet med sÃ¤kerhet att du tÃ¤nker och att du existerar eftersom om du skulle bliva lurad av en allsmÃ¤ktig demon som fÃ¶rsÃ¶ker lura dig i allt du kan bli lurad i, sÃ¥ Ã¤r lurendrejeriet i sig en tanke-process och dÃ¤rfÃ¶r vet du att tankar existerar (du tÃ¤nker). FÃ¶r att du ska bli lurad sÃ¥ mÃ¥ste du existera och dÃ¤rfÃ¶r vet du â€jag existerarâ€. Att bli lurad Ã¤r en tankeprocess och tÃ¤nkaren Ã¤r nÃ¶dvÃ¤ndig fÃ¶r att det ska finnas nÃ¥gon som blir lurad. SÃ¥ du vet: oavsett vad sÃ¥ tÃ¤nker du och existerar du. Ã…vanstÃ¥ende Ã¤r tvÃ¥ saker, eller hur? De Ã¤r bÃ¥da del av samma hjÃ¤rna och samma tankeprocess kan bli ens analytiska verktygssats/tÃ¤nkare, men vi erkÃ¤nner Ã¤ndÃ¥ att det finns distinkta entiteter â€“ att det finns distinktion. Detta kan ocksÃ¥ kallas separation. Vad Ã¤r distinktions motsats, anti-distinktion? Det Ã¤r en verklighet; det som allt Ã¤r del av; den Ã¤r en och dess definition i ordboken Ã¤r att allt Ã¤r del av den. Om vi skriver distinktion (tÃ¤nkare och tanke) pÃ¥ vÃ¤nster sida av ett papper och anti-distinktion (verkligheten; det som allt Ã¤r del av; en) pÃ¥ hÃ¶ger sida av pappret â€“ kan den vÃ¤nstra sidan se den hÃ¶gra sidan? Nej, fÃ¶r att oppositionen mellan distinktion och anti-distinktion. Det finns alltid en observerare (tÃ¤nkaren) och dÃ¤rmed distinktion i varje observation och dÃ¤rmed kan anti-distinktion ej representeras/ses.
HjÃ¤rnan evolverade fÃ¶r att hantera naturliga fenomen â€“ det fanns aldrig ett scenario i historien dÃ¥ nÃ¥gonting osynligt behÃ¶vde hanteras och betÃ¤nkas. DÃ¤rfÃ¶r antar vi att tanke-processen blev fel nÃ¤r vi sÃ¤ger att distinktion/vi inte kan se anti-distinktion/verkligheten. Men tankeprocessen gick inte fel: allt det betyder Ã¤r att det finns mer till verkligheten Ã¤n kan representeras. Oavsett hur vagt â€representerasâ€ Ã¤r definierat, lÃ¥t oss sÃ¤ga att en kaffekopp â€“ oavsett om hjÃ¤rnor Ã¤r involverade eller inte â€“ antas fÃ¶rsÃ¶ka representera det som allt Ã¤r del av, dÃ¥ gÃ¶r anti-distinktions-distinktions-oppositionen (motsÃ¤ttningen mellan distinktion och dess motsats) att representationen Ã¤r inkorrekt. Vi kan frÃ¥ga om en anti-distinkt â€sakâ€ har en maximumstorlek och dÃ¤rmed distinktion? Nej. PÃ¥ samma not Ã¤r ett annat bevis fÃ¶r att storleksskalan Ã¤r oÃ¤ndlig Ã¤r att vi ser nÃ¥gonting (vÃ¥r vardagsvÃ¤rld) samt kan gÃ¶ra hypoteser ad infinitum, och Ã¤ndÃ¥ representerar ingenting ALL verklighet. Verkligheten dvs storlek-tid Ã¤r dÃ¤rfÃ¶r oÃ¤ndligt.
En oÃ¤ndlig storleksskala Ã¤r en av pelarna i den existentiella teorin. En annan pelare Ã¤r att energimassa och rumtid Ã¤r motsatser (opposition) men sammanflÃ¤tade sÃ¥som i E=mc
2
(dÃ¤r c
2
hÃ¤nvisar till en hastighet dvs rum Ã¶ver tid: rumtid). Multiplikationen sammanfÃ¶r energimassa tillsammans med rumtid; ingenting tillsammans med nÃ¥gonting/allting; existens tillsammans med icke-existens. VarfÃ¶r finns det existens i form av min kropp? Utan att gÃ¥ in i det historiska svaret sÃ¥ kan man fÃ¶rklara det genom att sÃ¤ga att kroppen Ã¤r nÃ¥gonting i (sammanflÃ¤tat med) ingenting, av en storlek i en oÃ¤ndlig storleks-skala (dÃ¤r relationen mellan vilka tvÃ¥ storlekar som helst (eller objekt av tvÃ¥ storlekar) Ã¤r att de Ã¤r fÃ¶rklaringen till varandra dvs rÃ¤ttfÃ¤rdigar varandra. Sedan finns det ocksÃ¥, som tredje pelare, distinktions-anti-distinktions-opposition dvs vi lever i en singular (ej plural) verklighet men ser distinkta/separata entiteter sÃ¥som tÃ¤nkare och tanke.
PÃ¥ tal om rumtid, rumtid Ã¤r den logiska startpunkten fÃ¶r den tidsbaserade existentiella teorin. Ingenting (tom rumtid) behÃ¶ver inget inledande/tidigare rÃ¤ttfÃ¤rdigande eller anledning att existera, fÃ¶r att det existerar inte. I den, hursomhelst, Ã¤r naturlagarna sanna dvs den Ã¤r inte irrationell / anti-logisk, och bland naturlagarna finns de som, inklusive E=mc
2
, som nÃ¤mner energimassa. Skulle energimassa kunna â€nÃ¤mnasâ€ utan att det skulle existera? Om â€jaâ€ sÃ¥ skulle det vara absurt / anti-logiskt. VarfÃ¶r skulle verkligheten nÃ¤mna saker som aldrig existerar? Eftersom naturlagarna Ã¤r strikta och tack vare vÃ¥r regel â€det som nÃ¤mns mÃ¥ste existera eller uppstÃ¥â€ sÃ¥ fÃ¥r vi, varÃ¤n (i de minsta storlekarna) dÃ¤r E=mc
2
nÃ¤mns, sÃ¥ finns existens och dÃ¤rfÃ¶r en tÃ¤t big bang. Faktumet att galaxer rusar ivÃ¤g accelererandes frÃ¥n varandra leder till ingenting (tom rymd) i framtiden, och med mellanhanden â€naturlagarâ€ sÃ¥ uppstÃ¥r energimassa igen sÃ¥ tÃ¤t som den kan vara. Ingen tids-delay mellan ingenting â€“ naturlagar â€“ energimassa men sÃ¥ snart en begrÃ¤nsad (av event-horizons som bestÃ¤ms av ljuset Ã¤ndliga hastighet) region blir ingenting/tomrum, sÃ¥ uppstÃ¥r en big bang som sedan genom kosmisk expansion blir ingenting igen, som sedan blir tomrum och en ny big bang igen. Detta Ã¤r den tidsmÃ¤ssiga beskrivningen om varfÃ¶r energimassa (som existerar sammanflÃ¤tad med rumtid sÃ¥som i E=mc
2
) bÃ¶rjar tÃ¤t och blir ingenting, och sedan repetitation.
Det Ã¥vanstÃ¥ende Ã¤r en rivalteori till â€Gud skapade jorden pÃ¥ 6 dagar och vilade pÃ¥ den sjundeâ€. Den Ã¤r inte intuitiv eftersom den har att gÃ¶ra med saker som vi inte hade att gÃ¶ra med under evolutionen: osynliga energimassarumtid/verkligheten/anti-distinktion som del av vÃ¥rt resonemang. Den har ocksÃ¥ en multi-anledning orsak fÃ¶r vÃ¥r existens: en tidsvis rationale involverandes bÃ¶rjan och slutet pÃ¥ big bang, kombinerad med en 3-pelares existentiell teori som rÃ¤ttfÃ¤rdigar storlek och energimassa. Den Ã¤r abstrakt/vetenskaplig men kan inte reduceras till simplare termer. Det Ã¤r den minsta gemensamma nÃ¤mnaren som alla kan tro pÃ¥ (oavsett religion).
Hur vagt har verkligheten definerat â€att representeraâ€?
OÃ¤ndligt vagt â€“ vad som helst kan representera vad som helst.
Ã„r representationen/representÃ¶ren verkligheten eller Allah?
Nej.
Kan nÃ¥gonting representera det som allt Ã¤r del av?
Nej.
DÃ¥ Ã¤r storleks-tids-diagrammet oÃ¤ndligt dvs inget representerar verkligheten. Hur mÃ¥nga Ã¤r den? Hur mÃ¥nga Ã¤r Allah? 1.
Sa denâ€¦, eller skrev den en bok?
Detta motbevisar att Allah skrev en bok.
Igen: hur mycket av verkligheten kan representeras av, sÃ¤g, en mÃ¥lning? All den?
Nej, hela verkligheten kan ej representeras. Precis som Allah inte kan fÃ¥ngas i ett ord/en bild.
Vi kan ha hypoteser â€“ hur mÃ¥nga hypoteser kan vi ha?
Om verkligheten Ã¤r storlekar och tider, energimassa och rumtid sÃ¥ Ã¤r det rektangulÃ¤ra storleks-tids-diagrammet med energimassarumtid i varje koordinat det universella sÃ¤ttet att representera allt som finns att representera.
Skriver den bÃ¶cker? Nej, den Ã¤r inte av fÃ¶rfattarnatur.
â€Gud sa till Muhammed ord fÃ¶r ordâ€¦â€ Ã¤r alltsÃ¥ ett falskt eller som mest ett metaforiskt pÃ¥stÃ¥ende.
â€Du mÃ¥ste gÃ¶ra ritualer fÃ¶r att inte hamna i helvetet, och i himmelen fÃ¥r du 72 oskulderâ€ Ã¤r med samma logik ocksÃ¥ ett falskt pÃ¥stÃ¥ende.
Det finns tre alternativ som fundament fÃ¶r denna logik â€“ kan du tÃ¤nka ut ett fjÃ¤rde?
1: Verkligheten Ã¤r ett synonym fÃ¶r Allah,
2: eller sÃ¥ finns inte Allah
3: eller sÃ¥ finns 72 oskulder (ej ett alternativ eftersom verkligheten inte Ã¤r av den naturen, dÃ¥ den Ã¤r storleks-tids-energimassarumtid, att den skriver bÃ¶cker).
Som tillÃ¤gg till det rektangulÃ¤ra storleks-tids-diagrammet med oÃ¤ndlighetssymboler i varje hÃ¶rn, och den evolutionÃ¤ra triangeln som representerar att livet blev mer komplext ju mer tiden gick (triangelns spets har sitt ursprung i mittersta storleken i den kÃ¤nda storleksskalan), finns fÃ¶ljande hjÃ¤rn-diagram:
Den existentiella teorin med dess tre pelare, dvs en oÃ¤ndlig storleksskala, energimassarumtid och distinktions-anti-distinktions-opposition, fÃ¶rutsÃ¤ger att det borde finnas en liten bit DNA som kopierar sig.
Evolutionsteorin bÃ¶rjar med den fÃ¶rsta reproducerande formen. Det var en form som samlande kringliggande massa till en liknande form. Den existentiella teorin fÃ¶rutsÃ¤ger existensen av oÃ¤ndligt mÃ¥nga sÃ¥dana former. Det som oundvikligen blir sant nÃ¤r man har reproduktion Ã¤r att vissa dÃ¶r medan andra Ã¶verlever (liv och dÃ¶d), att antalet avkomma/kopior formen gÃ¶r har betydelse och att det finns mutationer Ã¶ver tid. FÃ¶ljande Ã¤r sant om formens avkomma: vissa dÃ¶r medan andra Ã¶verlever, antalet avkomma har betydelse och avkomman Ã¤r annorlunda frÃ¥n originalformen. Dessa tre regler / naturlagar var inaktiva innan den fÃ¶rsta reproduktionen skedde. NÃ¤sta stora steg var nÃ¤r ett av dessa former mÃ¶jliggjorde fÃ¶r sig sjÃ¤lv att injicera sitt DNA in i andra formers reproduktiva mekanism, vilket utnyttjade princip nr 2: att antalet avkomma har betydelse. Det var det fÃ¶rsta viruset: den hijackade andras reproduktion. Regeln / naturlagen som kom i spel i.om. denna hÃ¤ndelse var att â€maktâ€ har betydelse: att hijacka andras reproduktiva mekanism ger evolutionÃ¤ra fÃ¶rdelar. Nu har vi lagt fram de fyra huvudregelerna som Ã¤r evolutionsteori: fÃ¶rst kom de tre fÃ¶rsta reglerna, sedan kom den fjÃ¤rde: makt. NÃ¤sta stora hÃ¤ndelse â€“ fÃ¶r att skydda mot att virus hijackar alla reproduktiva system â€“ var att ett immunsystem evolverade fÃ¶r att skydda mot virus hijacks-fÃ¶rsÃ¶k. Detta behÃ¶vde multicellulÃ¤rism. Precis som immunsystem krÃ¤ver multicellularism, sÃ¥ behÃ¶ver immunsystem multikÃ¶nadhet: fÃ¶r att vinna i kampen dÃ¤r virus muterar fÃ¶r att kringgÃ¥ immunsystem sÃ¥ behÃ¶ver immunsystemet ocksÃ¥ maximalt med mutation. Att mixa gener frÃ¥n tvÃ¥ kÃ¶n skapar ett mer muterat immunsystem, vilket hÃ¥ller ut i kampen mot virus dÃ¤r virus â€fÃ¶rsÃ¶kerâ€ mutera sig runt immunsystemet. Den nÃ¤sta stora hÃ¤ndelsen var att en av dessa multicellulÃ¤ra organismer â€“ en fisk eller mask â€“ av det manliga kÃ¶net muterade till att vara agressiv och fÃ¶rinta andra manliga varelser. Han skulle ha fÃ¥tt hÃ¶gre tillgÃ¥ng till kvinnliga organismer jÃ¤mfÃ¶rt med hans icke-agressiva likar. Detta kan ocksÃ¥ kallas â€maktâ€ eftersom agressiva hanar hijackar andra hanars tillgÃ¥ng till kvinnor genom att dÃ¶da hanarna. Detta orsakar dinosaurierna eftersom stÃ¶rre muskelmassa och skarpare vapen Ã¤r bÃ¤ttre pÃ¥ att dÃ¶da rivalerna. Bland dinosaurierna fanns moder-avkomma-bandet, ditplacerad av evolutionen eftersom det var en fÃ¶rdel fÃ¶r mÃ¶drar att se sina barn Ã¶verleva till vuxenskap. Detta band muterade till att involvera flock-medlemmar eftersom en grupp sammarbetandes bÃ¤ttre kan vinna Ã¶ver individualister i brÃ¥k om vad som helst. NÃ¤sta stora steg var att nÃ¥gon kartlade flocken, i sin hjÃ¤rna, som en hierarki (upp-ned-axeln) med en lÃ¤ngtan efter att stÃ¥ hÃ¶gst upp i hierarkin. Denna kapitalistiska tÃ¤vlan mot toppen gjorde att hjÃ¤rnan vÃ¤xte sig stÃ¶rre â€“ stÃ¶rre minnesbank, mer detaljrika fÃ¶rutsÃ¤gelser och snabbare planering Ã¤r alla fÃ¶rdelar som kommer frÃ¥n att ha ett stÃ¶rre kortex.
Du har en komposit-sÃ¤ker sanning bestÃ¥endes av tvÃ¥ sÃ¤kra sanningar: du kan med sÃ¤kerhet sÃ¤ga att du tÃ¤nker (fÃ¶r att om du skulle bli lurad: att bli lurad Ã¤r en tankeprocess) och att du existerar (eftersom att bli lurad krÃ¤ver den som blir lurad). Jag tÃ¤nker och jag finns Ã¤r ett pÃ¥stÃ¥ende men tvÃ¥ sanningar. Du kan med sÃ¤kerhet pÃ¥stÃ¥ dig ha â€distinktionâ€ eftersom du har att gÃ¶ra med multipla separata entiteter (sÃ¥som â€jagâ€ och â€tankarâ€). Man kan sÃ¤ga, nÃ¤r man ser den sÃ¤kra sanningens â€jag tÃ¤nkerâ€ och â€jag existerarâ€, att avstÃ¥endet/mellanrummet mellan de tvÃ¥ idÃ©erna (tÃ¤nkare och tanke) Ã¤r distinktion. AvstÃ¥endet/mellanrummet som separarar tÃ¤nkare frÃ¥n tanke Ã¤r nÃ¶dvÃ¤ndigt fÃ¶r â€disktinktionâ€ att hÃ¤rledas som sÃ¤ker sanning fÃ¶ljandes ur nÃ¤sta logiska steg, med ursprunget av den originella primÃ¤ra sÃ¤kra sanningen.
Ã„r alla distinkta entiteter del av en singulÃ¤r verklighet om â€verklighetenâ€ Ã¤r definierad som â€det som allt Ã¤r del avâ€? Med andra ord: om vi ritar distinktion pÃ¥ vÃ¤nster sida av ett papper och anti-distinktion (distinktionÂ´s motsats: en ensam verklighet â€“ det som allt Ã¤r del av. Zoomandes ut maximalt) pÃ¥ hÃ¶ger sida av pappret, kan dÃ¥ distinktion representera hÃ¶ger sida av pappret dvs anti-distinktion? Hur skulle nÃ¥gon distinkt entitet kunna vara/representera motsatsen till vad representation/distinktion Ã¤r? Vilken representation som helst av anti-distinktion/verkligheten mÃ¥ste ha minst tre entiteter: tÃ¤nkare, mellanrummet mellan tÃ¤nkare och tanke, och tanke.
Separation/distinktion Ã¤r antaget i representation, vilket innebÃ¤r att anti-distinktion Ã¤r orepreserbart.
Hur vagt har universum/Gud definerat vad en representation Ã¤r dvs nÃ¤r en representation sker? VÃ¥ra hjÃ¤rnor anvÃ¤nder neuroner fÃ¶r att representera, men vad sÃ¤gs om â€“ istÃ¤llet fÃ¶r neuroner (oavsett om hjÃ¤rnor Ã¤r inblandade eller inte) â€“ universum lÃ¥ter vilket slumpmÃ¤ssigt valt objekt som helst lÃ¥ta sig sÃ¤gas, sÃ¥som neuroner sÃ¤gs, representera verkligheten? Universum har definierat â€representationâ€ oÃ¤ndligt vagt dvs uteslutandes hjÃ¤rnor sÃ¥ kan vilket slumpmÃ¤ssigt objekt som helst spotant bli/vara symbolen fÃ¶r all verklighet â€“ fÃ¶r att universum har definierat â€representeraâ€ oÃ¤ndligt vagt. Trots den oÃ¤ndligt vaga definitionen av vad som representerar vad, sÃ¥ gÃ¶r distinktions-anti-distinktions-oppositionen (linjen som separerar vÃ¤nster sida av pappret frÃ¥n hÃ¶ger sida; motsÃ¤ttningen mellan distinktion och anti-distinktion) att verkligheten Ã¤r orepresenterbar. Om verkligheten Ã¤r anti-distinktion dÃ¥ finns ingen distinktion (representation Ã¤r oundvikligen distinktion), trots universums oÃ¤ndligt vaga definition av â€representeraâ€, fÃ¥nga verkligheten. I representationer kan vi rÃ¤kna minst tre saker och det vi fÃ¶rsÃ¶ker representera Ã¤r en sak utan nÃ¥gonting utanfÃ¶r den. Faktumet att representationer innehÃ¥ller distinktion gÃ¶r att att fÃ¥nga verkligheten (allt som ett) omÃ¶jligt.
Vi kan ha oÃ¤ndligt mÃ¥nga eller oÃ¤ndligt innehÃ¥llsfulla/stora representationer/hypoteser â€“ sÃ¥som ett oÃ¤ndligt storleks-tids-diagram â€“ och genom att abstrakt peka till verkligheten, sÃ¥ gÃ¶r universums regel att ingenting representerar verkligheten trots universums oÃ¤ndligt vaga definition av â€representeraâ€ av oÃ¤ndligt mycket, gÃ¶r verkligheten orepresenterbar. Detta kan bara betyda en sak: verkligheten â€“ som vi kÃ¤nner som storlekar och tider (ett storleks-tids-diagram) â€“ Ã¤r oÃ¤ndligt. Det finns oÃ¤ndligt stort och oÃ¤ndligt litet med oÃ¤ndligt mycket dÃ¥tid och oÃ¤ndligt mycket framtid. Detta rektangulÃ¤ra storleks-tids-diagram dvs vÃ¥r vardagsvÃ¤rld av storlek-tid har oÃ¤ndligheter Ã¶verallt.
Energimassa i rumtid: ett i noll, existens i icke-existens, nÃ¥gonting i ingenting â€“ sÃ¥som definierats av E=mc
2
dÃ¤r c
2
stÃ¥r fÃ¶r ljusets hastighet (rum Ã¶ver tid dvs rumtid/noll/icke-existens) och E=m refererar till energimassa (existens, nÃ¥gonting, allt).
Distinktions-anti-distinktions-opposition: vi lever i en singulÃ¤r verklighet men vi ser multipla objekt.
En oÃ¤ndlig storleksskala.
De Ã¥vanstÃ¥ende tre idÃ©erna Ã¤r en existentiell teori (en teori som fÃ¶rklarar existensen av en reproduktiv form dvs evolutions bÃ¶rjan dvs vÃ¥r existens). Det Ã¤r modernt att anvÃ¤nda sig av tre likvÃ¤rdiga idÃ©er fÃ¶r att fÃ¶rklara ens existens â€“ alla tidigare existentiella teorier har antingen anvÃ¤nt en enda idÃ© (monoteism) eller en saga/myt (mÃ¥nga vardagliga (ej vetenskapliga/abstrakta) idÃ©er) fÃ¶r att fÃ¶rklara existens.
Den fÃ¶rutsÃ¤gande kvalitÃ©n som gÃ¶r denna existentiella teori till en vetenskaplig teori Ã¤r att den, baserat pÃ¥ en oÃ¤ndlig storleksskala av energimassarumtid och distinktions-anti-distinktions-opposition, fÃ¶rutsÃ¤ger att det i en oÃ¤ndlig storleksskala borde finnas en storlek dÃ¤r reproduktion (DNA) sker. Den existentiella teorin fÃ¶rutsÃ¤ger det fÃ¶rsta DNA:t, och frÃ¥n det fÃ¥r vi evolutionÃ¤r teori.
En annan fÃ¶rutsÃ¤gande kvalitÃ© Ã¤r att teorin fÃ¶rutsÃ¤ger att big bang borde varit
tÃ¤t
. A-priori begynnelsen av universum Ã¤r logiskt sett tomhet eftersom tomhet inte behÃ¶ver nÃ¥gon tidigare/fÃ¶religgande logiskt rÃ¤ttfÃ¤rdigande eftersom det ej existerar. I tom rumtid Ã¤r naturlagarna sanna, sÃ¥som naturlagarna som hanterar energimassa (sÃ¥som E=mc
2
), och dÃ¤rfÃ¶r bÃ¶rjar big bang oÃ¤ndligt tÃ¤t â€“ fÃ¶r att E=mc
2
Ã¤r lika sann samtidigt i de minsta storlekarna. De minsta tomma rymderna hade E=mc
2
som sann inom sig direkt nÃ¤r det fanns ingenting, vilket fÃ¶rutsÃ¤ger en tÃ¤t big bang. En region, inom event horizons gjorda av energimassa rusandes ivÃ¤g i >c (pga mÃ¶rk energi accelererandes kosmisk expansion) Ã¤r per definition â€ingentingâ€ i vilket E=mc
2
Ã¤r sann i de minsta utrymmena, vilket Ã¥stadkommer en big bang utom rÃ¤ckhÃ¥ll fÃ¶r de nÃ¤rmaste ( v = >c) energimassa. Ingenting (utom rÃ¤ckhÃ¥ll fÃ¶r nÃ¤rmaste energimassa fÃ¶r att den Ã¤r pÃ¥ vÃ¤g bortÃ¥t i >c) orsakas i centrumpunkten som har event horizons som grÃ¤ns lÃ¤ngst bort, vilket leder till en big bang (eftersom naturlagarna uppbringar energimassa i det tomma centrumet).
Det Ã¤r en stor historisk hÃ¤ndelse att det Ã¤ntligen finns ett ateistiskt argument i form av en universitetskurs: det Ã¤r en existentiell teori plus evolution som inte behÃ¶ver en personifierad gud fÃ¶r att fungera, utan dess pelare (oÃ¤ndlig storleksskala av energimassarumtid och distinktions-anti-distinktions-opposition) kan inte ha en personifierad gud tillagd till dem som en fjÃ¤rde pelare utan att teorin lÃ¥ter lÃ¶jlig. Det Ã¤r inte bara sÃ¥ att teorin inte behÃ¶ver en personifierad gud, utan att lÃ¤gga till en gud fÃ¶rstÃ¶r teorins minimalistiska rationellt kompletta skÃ¶nhet. Gudar fÃ¶rfular teorin. Teorins upptÃ¤ckt Ã¤r en stor historisk hÃ¤ndelse eftersom aldrig fÃ¶rr har en hel kurs (bÃ¶rjandes med sÃ¤ker sanning, gÃ¥endes genom den existentiella teorin och slutandes i evolution) lagts fram i ateismens intellektuella debatt, som ett argument mot en personifierad gud.
Anatomin i hjÃ¤rnan frÃ¥n att hÃ¶ra sÃ¤ker sanning (jag tÃ¤nker & jag finns) â€“ bÃ¶rjan av denna kurs â€“ skapar samma neuronala pathways / associationer mellan idÃ©er i varje person som hÃ¶r vet sÃ¤ker sanning. Det logiska steget till â€distinktionâ€ Ã¤r att notera, som meta-analys av den primÃ¤ra sÃ¤kra sanningen â€“ att man har mÃ¥nga idÃ©er (jag tÃ¤nker OCH jag finns) och att man kan ta den logiska vÃ¤gen till nÃ¤sta steg i kursen (distinktion finns). Att sedan motsÃ¤tta anti-distinktion med distinktion skapar den ofÃ¶rnimmbara â€“ â€mot resonâ€ (eftersom logik Ã¤r, i simpla mÃ¤nniskor, enbart visuell) â€“ slutsatsen att vi/distinktion inte kan se verkligheten/anti-distinktion. Distinktions-anti-distinktions-oppositionen Ã¤r svÃ¥rbegriplig fÃ¶r att den â€“ sÃ¥som formell logik eller matematik â€“ enbart anvÃ¤nder ord istÃ¤llet fÃ¶r bilder (den lingvistiska hjÃ¤rnhalvan istÃ¤llet fÃ¶r den visuella). Vi evolverade till att sÃ¤ga â€om jag kan se det sÃ¥ tror jag pÃ¥ detâ€ och det Ã¤r en god tumregel eftersom praktiska sekvenser hÃ¤ndelser kan verifieras som sanna eller osanna genom att visualisera dem. Men i denna filosofi: nej â€“ det mÃ¥ste vara lingvistiskt att vi fÃ¶rnekar oss sjÃ¤lva konceptet â€all verklighetâ€, vilket leder till slutsatsen att det finns mer till verkligheten Ã¤n nÃ¥gonting â€“ oavsett hur vagt universum definerat â€att representeraâ€ â€“ representerar. Detta tillÃ¤gger oÃ¤ndligt mÃ¥nga storlekar till vÃ¥r abstrakta stoorleksskala / storleks-tids-diagrammet; det gÃ¶r en rektangel (med storlek pÃ¥ y-axeln och tid pÃ¥ x-axeln) med oÃ¤ndlighetstecken i varje hÃ¶rn, som i sin tur blir en pelare i vÃ¥r personlig-gud-fÃ¶rnekande existentiella teori.
Att komma frÃ¥n sÃ¤ker sanningen genom enbart logiska steg (meta-analyser och motsÃ¤ttningsskapande av motsatser) till en existentiell teori som fÃ¶rutsÃ¤er evolutionen Ã¤r en stor historisk hÃ¤ndelse i ateismens historia.
I ett historiskt sammanhang Ã¤r anatomin (neurala anslutningar mellan idÃ©er och sekvenser logik) som skapas av denna kurs som ett paradigm-shifte in i en ny era av civilisation â€“ en era liknande den som finns pÃ¥ oÃ¤ndligt mÃ¥nga planeter vars vetenskap kommit lÃ¤ngre Ã¤n vÃ¥ra 4.5 miljarder Ã¥rs mittenpunkt i en vanlig vattenbÃ¤rande planets historia.
Evolution, genom att bÃ¶rja frÃ¥n â€en massa som samlar kringliggande massa till en liknande formâ€ kliver fram frÃ¥n den existentiella teorins oÃ¤ndliga storleksskala av energimassarumtid. Om vi antar att DNA Ã¤r replikationsmolekylen sÃ¥ kan vi ta steget till â€“ klivandes Ã¶ver hur cellvÃ¤ggar evolverade osv â€“ till att virus hijackar andras reproduktiva system. Detta â€“ i den universella inter-planetÃ¤ra rymdvarelsekulturen â€“ formuleras som, i bÃ¶cker av logik, som att de tre fÃ¶rsta reglerna uppkommer (liv/dÃ¶d, antalet avkomma har betydelse och â€det sker mutationer i varje generationsskifteâ€) och sedan att en fjÃ¤rde regel uppkommer (makt, med virus). Denna historia â€“ som i vÃ¥r kurs bÃ¶rjar frÃ¥n den fÃ¶rsta reproduktiva formen och slutar i att finslipa anatomin bakom makt i mÃ¤n â€“ Ã¤r visualiseringsbar som en grottmanna-historias narrativ likt dem vi evolverade till att se/hÃ¶ra. Vi kan proof-checka/validera historian genom att se den visuellt. Evolutions visuella natur Ã¤r i stark kontrast till den rent linguistiska/abstraka natur som den existentiella teorin har.
PÃ¥ tal om â€abstraktaâ€ beskrivningar dvs beskrivningar som gÃ¶r det vÃ¤ldigt klart fÃ¶r oss att vÃ¥r fÃ¶rstÃ¥else av universum bara Ã¤r en karta (en referens) och inte verkligheten i sig (tÃ¤nk pÃ¥ PlatoÂ´s och KantÂ´s grottmetafor och â€saken Ã¤r inte saken sjÃ¤lvâ€-filosofierâ€)â€¦ Storleksskalan av energimassarumtid, i storleken av kvantfysik har oss beskrivandes fotoner etc anvÃ¤ndandes bÃ¥de vÃ¥g-beskrivningar med fokus pÃ¥ lÃ¤ngder i rymd (dessa Ã¤r â€rumtids-beskrivningarâ€) OCH â€“ i vÃ¥r-partikel-dualitet â€“ energimassabeskrivningen dvs att energin i en foton Ã¤r dess fÃ¤rg. FÃ¤rg (sÃ¥som den uppfattas genom Ã¶gonen), vÃ¥g/rumtids-beskrivningen och partikel-energi/energimassa-beskrivningen Ã¤r alla legitimea beskrivningar av kvantfysiken. VÃ¥r fÃ¶rmÃ¥ga att beskriva vilken massa/vilket fenomen som helst med bÃ¥de energimassa- och rumtids-beskrivningar lÃ¶per genom hela storleksskalan. Du kan fÃ¶restÃ¤lla dig tvÃ¥ linjer â€“ en fÃ¶r energimassa och en fÃ¶r rumtid â€“ gÃ¥endes vertikalt genom alla bilder pÃ¥ storleks-axeln. TillÃ¤ggandes komplexitet pÃ¥ detta finns det tvÃ¥ linjer till â€“ tyngdlagen och elektromagnetism â€“ bÃ¥da gÃ¥endes lÃ¤ngs storleks-axeln, tyngdlagen har dess dualitet av energimassa- och rumtids-beskrivningar och elektromagnetism likasÃ¥ har desamma, dvs energimassa och rumtidsbeskrivningar. Tyngdlagen Ã¤r bÃ¥de Newtonisk â€massor dras till massorâ€ (energimassas fokus pÃ¥ massa) och Einsteinsk â€rumtids krÃ¶kningâ€ (rumtids fokus pÃ¥ rum) â€“ bÃ¥da beskrivningar Ã¤r korrekta.
Vi Ã¤r halvvÃ¤gs igenom en planets historia â€“ 4.5 miljarder Ã¥r har gÃ¥tt och 5 miljarder Ã¥terstÃ¥r. Teorin som du nu vet Ã¤r m.a.o. i kosmisk majoritet â€“ fler planeter har den Ã¤n har den inte (om det tar ungefÃ¤r hÃ¤lften av planetens historia att uppfinna den och om den kvarstÃ¥r under andra hÃ¤lften av planetens historia). De flesta andra planeter dvs majoriteten av rymdvarelser Ã¤r m.a.o. ideologiska anhÃ¤ngare av teorin. Sprid denna teori fÃ¶r att fÃ¥ bekrÃ¤ftelse av majoriteten trots att den bor ljusÃ¥r bort. Just nu lever 99.9% av jordens befolkning i eran av religioner â€“ sprid denna teori fÃ¶r att fÃ¥ slut pÃ¥ religiÃ¶sa krig samt terrorism sÃ¥som 9/11. VÃ¤rldsbilden (bilden/diagrammet som fÃ¶rklarar vÃ¤rlden) Ã¤r densamma i den kosmiska majoriteten.
Jag har jobbat i 10 Ã¥r fÃ¶r att Ã¥stadkomma teorin och som ensam om att kÃ¤nna till den Ã¤r det mitt ansvar att den sprids. Den framtida civilizationen i vilken alla har samma vÃ¤rldsbild hÃ¤nger dÃ¤rfÃ¶r pÃ¥ mig. Jag kÃ¤nner en unik mÃ¶jlighet att pÃ¥verka jordens framtid.

Can we
timetravel? We can proceed from era to era, just like dinosaurs preceded man and not vice versa â€“ its a universal sequence on any planet.
Heaven/karma instinctual but collides with main picture.
Water, primordial soup, proteins, dns strand. Single cell reproducing multiplying. Then 1 of these cells thought â€œill inject my own dna into some other cellâ€, hijack its reproductive system. Very beneficial. So first there were 3 rules: life n death, number of offspring matters and mutation in each generationshift, then with viruses came the 4th rule â€œpowerâ€ â€“ hijacking othersâ€™ reproductive system. Then theres an arms race between viruses and â€¦ â€œOur kind ofâ€ organism, so to mutate our immune system faster two genders arose. Then fights between males led to the dinosaurs. Then brains bonded into groups to fight individualists. Then capitalist power struggles within the group made the brain grow larger, weâ€™re good at planning and remembering things. Then we get to kingdoms. From the water puddle to the 21 st century. Those who proceed to the next era will live in a world where holy book-group bonds are weak and a universal courses group bond is the strongest, thus national wars or civilizational wars where identity is based on other than this science will be impossible. The planet has two future ways to go 60 years from now and one is better but needs some investment of time until everybody knows this course.
Theres a universal course/book thats on every advanced enough planet throughout the universe and at the regeneration of every universe. If you consider the entire corpus of human knowledge, youd find 3 rational starting points: certain truth, nothingness and that reality is one. Just like dinosaurs predate humans the first chapter with the 3 starting points predate the connecting of â€œi think n i exist, distinctionâ€ and â€œreality is one, antidistinction. Which leads to that there is more to reality than can be contemplated meaning that its infinite. Thats chaper 2: like multiplication and division are much higher levels of mathematics than adding and subtracting, chaper 2 is higher than the starting points in chapter 1.
â€”â€”â€”
If you want to be altruistic/selfless you can think about the millions of lives lost or living as refugees due to religious wars and group-loyalties based on ideology/religion. What if group-loyalty could be, for everyone, based on a single universal ideology? Then friendship ties, shared histories, well-mixing personalities and the like would form groups that donÂ´t have a religious mission/an ideological drive. When all ideologies are erased â€“ and religions too â€“ then simple biological mechanisms like common goals, shared interests and family ties bind us together â€“ and those kind of conglomerations are more likely to disintegrate than if there is a holy book or any ideological book as the binding principle between people. If ISIS would be educated then it would disintegrate and many civil wars break out among different families in Iraq/Syria â€“ but there would not be this major cleft between western&modern and holy&dogmatic.
If you want to be selfish like Ayn Rand: the upcoming world order / economy will be a meritocracy based on who advances or knows the most science. The ancient Chinese had a government where even the lowest peasant, if he passed a test in ConfusciousÂ´ teachings, could elevate himself higher in the society. Hierarchy is based on what is objectively to be admired; hierarchy is based on what infinitely many extraterrestrials in consensus have agreed upon be the criteria for how a humanÂ´s thoughts should be wired; hierarchy is based on the universeÂ´s disposition to reward those with the most accurate world-view or whom advance the pre-existing world-view and spread it to others â€“ the universe wants us choose to elevate in the hierarchy those whom appriciate the universe most fully, wholistically and most accurately. The old power-system based on money is upheld by banks and is based on present day humansÂ´ ties to the past. There will be an overlap between the old bank-based system for establishing VIP-status and the new economy which is a meritocracy based on science. If we want to be like planets ahead of us in the evolution of history, we ought to adapt the meritocracy-economy. After a few generations inherited money seems less legitimate than knowing or advancing science and by doing so wiring oneÂ´s cortex (flexible thinking part of the brain) as universally as possible (as much like the consensus among extraterrestrials is as possible).
There are three universal starting points for the universal course which will wire your brain universally. What I mean by â€œuniversalâ€ is that:
A) it is based on science meaning that it is retrievable from anywhere at any time; it is available universally unlike some time-specific language-specific location-specific holy-book-revalation.
B) universal means that it is how aliens/extraterrestrials sooner or later wire their brains. Sure: they can choose to live in a multi-worldviewical world but sooner or later the truth will conquer meaning that all various ideas among every tribe or nation will congregate (like a lens focuses many beams of light into one focal point) into a single set of ideas and prioritarizations â€“ a single world-view will emerge from the many. It is the identical world-view that all civilizing planets will congregate to/toward because science is universal. This congregating is as much of a universal step in evolution as that a planet with water will eventually have bacteria. Eventually everyone will know the course and the idea of this book. â€œWhat do you believe?â€ will no longer be a question because everyone has wired their cortexÂ´s ideas based on universal ideas/science.
â€”â€”â€“
Am I a muslim?
I have my size-time-diagram into which everything fits and this diagram being infinite gives an existential theory because:
â€“ sizes justify (are the cause of) one another, so thereÂ´s infinite justification.
â€“ time is infinite and our universe is observed to become nothingness in the future, and nothingness would be absurd if not for the fact that in the smallest spaces energymass is summoned because E=mc2 is a stable, constant law of nature.
â€“ there can only be separate distinct entities if distinction is counter-balanced and happens in non-distinction (a singular Reality). This point is much like the previous point of that only in nothingness can somethingness be summoned.
God, then, if we are to look for a meaning for the word, cannot be:
â€“ a specific object, size nor time within something infinitely larger
â€“ cannot, by definition, be apart from and â€œbeyondâ€ [that of which all is part] (Reality). Reality being an infinite size- and time-range of energymasspacetime is enough of an existential theory to explain us being here, the Big Bang, and the rest of the questions. God would, if claimed to be â€œbeyondâ€ the existential theory, be an unnecessary unproven assumption but more to the point: God would be â€œunrealâ€ if Reality is defined as we define it here. Such â€œbeyond Realityâ€-gods are unreal. WhatÂ´s more is that the phrase â€œAllah akbarâ€ (God is the biggest/greatest) wouldnÂ´t be true if Reality/[that of which all is part] is God plus Reality â€“ if [that of which all is part] has two major components, God and an energymasspacetime sizerange etc (the existential theory), then the sum of those two components is greater than God.
God, thus, obviously means Reallity by the definition of God being the greatest. God is then infinite. It makes sense to see people in awe over how much they can study, when they know thereÂ´s infinitely many fields of science which we do not have access to but which are logical and necessities for Reality to hold together. There being nothing absurd in an infinite size-range that resembles our known size-range (from quantum physics to the visible universe) is awesome and the highest you could possibly worship. This again proves that God is just a synonym for Reality/the existential theory.
Having studied all fields of science i.e. all sizes is the known sizerange, seeing how they all make up (justify) eachother (that itÂ´s just zooming in and zooming out), the wisdom that the sizerange is infinite (that there are infinitely many sizes making up one another) from the distinction (I think & I am logical path) and anti-distinction (that Reality is one) -thing, is the reason why we exist and God is not some size (sizes are not minds, except through evolution). Having studied all known sizes and knowing that the sizerange is infinite: it is an explanation to why weÂ´re here (akin to the Adam and Eve story or â€œGod created earth in 6 daysâ€ story) but it is not a revalation-giving thing â€“ the Quran wasnÂ´t written by God because God is not the kind of thing that writes/dictates stories. God being an infinite sizerange as thus our Creator is true, but the true way to get knowledge, rituals/pictoral representations and even guidance is through my work, not the work of the holy book-writers. The holy book writers might have said something true about God (just like I do in my work) â€“ but that is true of science textbooks moreso â€“ and they all said false things such as that God talks/gives revalations/authors holy books.
I can see the bronze-age marketing-teamÂ´s standpoint: people are more prone to follow dictates if theyÂ´re said to come from something/someone â€œhigher than humanâ€ i.e. a God or a ghost/spirit. Being invisible in as nonsense-a-way as some rituals are, is great for marketing. Everyone knows how humans thing â€“ theyÂ´re themselves human; we are only partly rational (a computer is rational) in what we think â€“ all our animal lusts bias or interrupt the thoughts that are as logical as they get, but theyÂ´re always going to be based against an evolutionary background just like the pitfall that my abstract diagram-including infinity-mentioning world-view is more like algebra than â€œwhat a world-view (context in which we are) should be thinking about that we lived for millions of years on the savannah, only needing to know (in oneÂ´s world-view) where the water-source is or whom stands under whom in the social hierarchy. WeÂ´ve mapped geographies, the use-based properties of objects/tools and personalities (and still do) for a gazillion years â€“ only with the advent of science SOME of us achieved higher i.e. used their evolved meager toolkit with all its biases to scetch out something like the theory of evolution in the 1800s. Looking at the evolution of [what we use our memory for]/how we map our surroundings/our world-view, before we mapped social relationships we mapped geographies. Before we mapped the functions of inventions (tools) our map only contained caveman tools (sharp stones and spears). The next step is to map oneÂ´s context as an infinite size-time-diagram (where size and time are really the same, but abstract thinking allows us to separate them into two distinct axises) or energymasspacetime (with itsÂ´ many laws of nature found in every school textbook in the world) and the distinction-antidistinction-
thing which feels so awkward/abstract that one wonders why one needs it as pillar 3 of the existential theory: the answer is: it wasnÂ´t invented (the words â€œI see a distinct objectâ€ or â€œwhy is there distinction?â€ werenÂ´t said in the same breath as â€œReality is oneâ€ or â€œenergymass and spacetime uniteâ€) until I did it in the 21st century). It might seem trivial to mention that separate entities exist in a singular Reality â€“ itÂ´s so obvious (thatÂ´s why no-one cared to make a big fuzz out of inventing it) but it makes the existential theory have three pillars (all of which can seem obvious) and not 4 â€“ thereÂ´s nothing more to add to the existential theory once youÂ´ve added the obvious â€œseparation in antidistinctionâ€-statement. I want to know how aliens (the infinitely many of them, steered by science toward an incommon path) think because its synonymous to finding a TRUE â€œkey to historyâ€ (Marx thought the key was equality, Hitler thought the key was racial superiority and a brutally competative relationship between races, Capitalism thinks itÂ´s freedom (less government), some might think they â€œkey to historyâ€ is to fund technological development). â€œHow aliens thinkâ€ is a shorthand way of saying â€œthe key to historyâ€ or â€œwhat will happen next/eventually and in hindsight seen as akin to the era of ancient grecoroman culture, the Industrial Revolution or the Digital revolution)â€. ItÂ´s what weÂ´re steered towards; itÂ´s the closest thing we get to divine guidance. ItÂ´s simply universal (drawn on science and practiced by infinitely many aliens) guidance/suggestions/
recommendations that we, as a species, can choose to promogate and thus â€œfollowâ€ or if weÂ´ll stick to multiculturalismÂ´s many -ismÂ´s like political quran-based islamism or christian-based â€œthe holy book gave me thisâ€-morality and codes of conduct. Some -ismÂ´s are dangerous (like quran-based politics and law) while some -ismÂ´s like christianity give too much credit to the -ism for simple human decency (in an age of extreme wealth globally). When my tummy is full IÂ´m a decent person â€“ I try to make money but IÂ´m not desparate after extreme wealth because I know that my caveman-brainÂ´s â€œneedâ€ for power (through status-symbols and freedom of space my environment to maximize the effectiveness of my hobby (writing)) wonÂ´t get satisfied no matter what external extravaganzas trigger my eyeballs, nor can people (socializing) make me much more satisfied than I am right now because all that is interesting and that there is to people is their brain â€“ and after a few weeks together thereÂ´ll be nothing I know nor any mental tool that I use that wonÂ´t, despite copyright, be in the hands of my friend: we wonÂ´t talk science (me teaching him/her) after all the science has been taught. I donÂ´t care to teach trivia so when I say â€œI teach SCIENCEâ€ I mean a finite thing: the existential theory plus something from each level of the known sizerange. Getting a P.hD from specializing on finding the structure of a rare protein only found in the feet of Amazonian forrest-mice is to put your eyes too close to the diagram; P.hDs for specializing/having a very narrow topic for oneÂ´s mind to engage in are for people who donÂ´t see the forest for the trees and care to rather look at one leaf of one tree instead of thinking about and seeing the forest as a whole. IÂ´m a forest person â€“ a leaf 10 cm from my eyes just bugs me. ThatÂ´s why there is a finite repertoire to what I call â€œscienceâ€ â€“ it takes a few days for me (my accomplishment/my work) to be fully understood and if repeated repetative. One only needs to know why/where one exists (the existential theory) once â€“ one canÂ´t forget it because we are made to remember the very context in which we live (here an evolutionary bias helps us: when someone explains â€œwhat the world isâ€ we remember it because â€œwhat the world wasâ€ in caveman days was the most useful thing the brain could do â€“ in fact we evolved such large brains because bigger brains remember better (can moreso map social relationships, successfull or unsuccesfull learning-experiences). We want to climb upwards in the hierarchy, find a mate, etc but all these wants and needs would be useless (theyÂ´d having nothing to work on) if it werenÂ´t for the map (of social relationships etc) that our brain is capable of remembering. We are inclined to remember existential theories because such knowledge about our place in the context was as useful as mapping whom is married to whom. This bias, by the way, is something holy book writers used to get people interested in their book. â€œGod created earth in 6 days (not 5)â€ is memorable because of our bias toward wanting to know about â€œcreation of the worldâ€ â€“ so the number â€œ6 daysâ€ is remembered too because it adds to the map that we then work on to seek power and other evolutionary benefits. ItÂ´s hard to make plans that have one reach evolutionary benefits if one does not know oneÂ´s environment/the external world. â€œ6 days for creating this place/worldâ€ adds to oneÂ´s map of the environment/place/external world. We have a bias for remembering it. Too bad the bronze-age holy books used this marketing trick (â€œhey, letÂ´s say something about their world (like the creation of it) because that would be something they remember!â€) to give pseudo- existential theories. The holy books made sales because not only do people want information about their context, people also want God to talk and interfere with day-to-day personal activites. Once you have a pseudo-explanation for how/why the world was created, youÂ´re free to add to that pseudo-explanation that â€œthe creator talksâ€. ItÂ´s impossible to add such a talking thing to my existential theory â€“ not only is it unnecessary (my theory works stand-alone) but it also contradicts basically every concept of my existential theory. The very definitions of energymasspacetime (meaning that God had nothingness as the canvas to paint on â€“ a nothingness that needs energymass and summons it because of the laws of nature inherent in that nothingness â€“ and chose to paint a beginning with as-dense-as-can-be (just like E=mc2 wouldÂ´ve created it because E=mc2 is true in the smallest spaces). Where was God when this happened? CouldnÂ´t have been energymass because energymass is only summoned once the universe becomes pure nothingness. If God is not energymass and energymass is existence â€“ then God doesnÂ´t exist / God is nothing. What doesnÂ´t exist or is nothing doesnÂ´t give revalations to men, doesnÂ´t care whom you sleep with, etc. Is God or GodÂ´s heaven a location in our size of infinite spacetime? In that case God is simply a far-away alien (which warrants questions about its evolution) but again â€“ it doesnÂ´t talk to us because of the distance and we wouldnÂ´t be too impressed even if an evolved God did talk to us (we are quite like it â€“ our science is the same, our world-view is the same). God is not a location in a size but is God a size? The sizerange is infinite (as proven by distinction not being able to see antidistinction) and thatÂ´d mean that thereÂ´s a creator to God (and that thing too has a creator, ad infinitum) IN THE SAME WAY as humans built cities or atoms make molecules. Again, if God is a size it warrantÂ´s the question: is God every location of that size or is God, like humans, in a location of that size? Whatever be the case, God still couldnÂ´t communicate with us. Since God fits neither in the context of energymasspacetime nor the context of the sizerange, a God-theory absolutely contradicts the true theory. What is said about God â€“ that God is the greatest â€“ makes only one â€œlocationâ€/notion in the existential theory correspond to a non-talking uncaring God: the theory itself (and more precisely Reality/[that of which all is part]) is the greatest. It certainly doesnÂ´t hear/talk nor give revalations because it comes as an infinite sizerange of energymasspacetime. When you tell this science, you can get to the point where you define Reality as â€œthat of which all is partâ€ and the greatest â€“ you can even get to antidistinction/the unrepresentability of Reality (fully, because we do represent some things) and people might still hope that a talking God can exist. But as soon as you mention the less abstract (the more abstract was that [that of which all is part cannot be observed]), the God-theory either surrenders or is in conflict with a/the existential theory which certainly is true (anyone can verify how the components of the theory fit together, make sense and explain everything). God as a synonym for Reality is boring â€“ why do we even have two words if we mean the same (scientific sizerange) thing.
If you assume that God is a synonym for Reality (which comes as an infinite sizescale, which in turn predicts a DNA-strand somewhere and voila: everything is explained), then I believe in your God. It doesnÂ´t appriciate my appriciation of it though, nor do rituals, following rules (made by men) etc please it. If I am to â€œshow my appriciation to itâ€ I do it by writing as I do right now â€“ thatÂ´s my worship of it: but IÂ´m under no illusion that this writing would please God by being logical (eventhough Reality itself is logical too â€“ so we have something incommon) â€“ me writing can be called worship but the only appriciating recipients of my writing are me and readers of my text. Whatever I write about Reality/God doesnÂ´t please God (because God is not a thing that listens, likes worship by others and other human needs) â€“ whatever worshippers do, I hope they do it for themselves and for other humans because no-one else is able to care or comprehend the worship. I would do the muslim prayer if I felt that that kind of discipline would benefit me (and a few times I did get a good feeling from going to the mosque and being among worshippers). ItÂ´s so easy to adapt to the customs of oneÂ´s peers (and especially oneÂ´s superiors, if one believes that there are those) that my attitude toward worship/ritual is â€œwhen in Rome, do like the romans (if you or others gain something out of it)â€. The world is complex â€“ I could have the same attitude toward the beliefs of islam: that IÂ´ll just say that something is through eventhough it obviously isnÂ´t because it contradicts, say, a talking holy book-writing God. Could I make myself believe that something talkative is God? The belief disintegrates and I get the foul feeling of that IÂ´ve used my valuable memory to note down a lie everytime I would think just one step/association further from the belief itself. I can believe (in anything) but analyzing it even the smallest amount will make me disbelieve it. But when youÂ´re in the mood of not analyzing â€“ like when one is having a panic attack on oneÂ´s death-bed â€“ IÂ´ll be (extremely) simplistic and do what some people seem to always do: â€œbelieve (in something that breaks down when analyzed)â€. What confuses me is that some people believe all the time â€“ they seem perfectly sane but they believe in a talking, scripture-giving God (that doesnÂ´t fit anywhere in the existential theory). Do they need comfort (from untruth) all the time? It seems like theyÂ´re trying to argue their position, though. A perplexing phenomenon at first glance but when you consider that theyÂ´re uneducated about my existential theory, any theory will do (even a talking God-theory). I am not hateful of it when I see it in other people â€“ I see it as humorous/ridicilous â€“ but when it binds people together (to form what in essence is an army) and thereÂ´s many of them (10 000 religions/â€armiesâ€) the worldÂ´s got a problem. Binding people together through their shared scripture and their belief that something impossible is true is bad because groups tend to be more violent than individualists â€“ especially if their holy text 1) seems to bind billions of people to their army (morale-strength amplification in a group is the root of violence), and 2) preaches violence/disrespect (many holy books are xenophobic and eager to create an â€œus vs. themâ€-social dynamic). If the holy book is taken seriously (if it canÂ´t be thrown in the trash) then we have bronze-age xenophobia (based on who likes the book and who doesnÂ´t) creeping into the modern day, and we also have artificial bonding/loyalty â€“ we basically get groups who are hostile (or more disrespectful) toward anyone who doesnÂ´t see the point (â€œthereÂ´s a talking Godâ€) theyÂ´re promoting. ItÂ´s such an easily fixable problem: if you read my work you simply cannot believe in a talking God â€“ my professional role is that you can give me ANY individual and I can â€œconvertâ€ him/her into not believing in a talking God. Whether this person will follow his or her groupÂ´s rituals or codes of conduct, though, is up to them â€“ itÂ´s sheer peer pressure.
The â€œus vs. themâ€ â€œwe are a big groupâ€ (and especially) â€œwe should convert the whole world so that they use their precious memory for knowing nonsense like we doâ€ are such great reasons for violence â€“ and of course itÂ´s fixable because what these people lack is education: only where there is no theory, can a pseudo-theory take root. Only where there is no argument/debate/science can â€œGod talksâ€ seem like legitimate truth. This means that much of the worldÂ´s violence is due to a lack of education (about the big questions i.e. what I talk about). Sure: some religions can be interpreted to say â€œkill the infidelsâ€ or some other explicit declaration of war â€“ but itÂ´s hard for a religion to survive if it constantly preaces fighting (it must have more clever tactics than that â€“ but it does tend to seek world-dominion). IÂ´m not so worried that someone reads the Quran and thinks â€œIÂ´ll help the [unbelieves in the QuranÂ´s talking God] to get to hell faster, because the Quran says that thatÂ´s where they belongâ€. I am worried about that the Quran (or any holy book) is the glue that binds people together. Religion is the last glue before we enter an era where obviously arbitrary things like nationalism or language makes strangers feel more familiar with eachother. Nation and language arenÂ´t taken that seriously â€“ nor should religion be, but it is. This binding-effect that holy books have is what makes ISIS / the taliban etc so hard to defeat â€“ they think, not only that they have an all-seeing revalation-giving God on their side, but they also have the exact same copy of a book that a billion people have. They feel strong (with their, seemingly to them, superior numbers). Obviously ISIS underestimated the ability of the Quran to draw in arab nations into the fight over Iraq & Syria â€“ the modern world simply leaned on the fact that ISIS are not muslims because they interpret the bronze-age ramble wrong. But ISIS / the taliban is still a factor â€“ the quran binds too many people together in certain areas of the world â€“ violence is caused, due to the binding-effect, the â€œmoral superiorityâ€-effect, the â€œpower in numbers and billions of people read the Quranâ€-effect etc (all these effects are there even if you skip the parts about the talking God who word for word said the Quran) make men as prone to violence as anything can make them: theyÂ´re a group with an â€œus vs. themâ€ dogma & feeling and they feel like they have power in numbers. Add to that the frustration over having to finance an own home before one can ejaculate. Those circumstances can make the group take up arms and â€œsend the infidels where they belongâ€. Following the commandments frustrates, the whole notion of â€œletÂ´s all prioritize this text highest (our favorite book) so that weÂ´re bound togetherâ€ and that the text itself can be interpreted as violent all are a breeding-ground for trouble â€“ and when youÂ´re in the trouble that the text creates, you are not in the state of mind to do the internal debate necessary to disprove a talking God and thus make your whole way of life become something that you either do as meaningless fun or donÂ´t do because no-one cares. But just as some people want to become professional soccer players and some atheists do zen-meditation, humans (by personal preference) want hobbies, to take up a discipline, to do something that adds, say, pride to their life. I donÂ´t personally care about soccer and I donÂ´t feel pride from doing any ritual, but I can definitely see that others take the muslim prayers like an athlete takes their sport. ItÂ´s possible to find out the objective truth about whether these prayers â€œplease God or notâ€ (by, like IÂ´ve done in this text, disproving all kinds of false Gods and making the real God more mundane and not a talker). Rituals donÂ´t please Reality/â€the energymasspacetime sizerangeâ€ because it is not a thing that gets pleased â€“ itÂ´s like trying to please a rock. You do the prayers because you enjoy the pride/hobby for its own sake â€“ like someone doing sports likes his/her sport. Pleasing a rock/God to get to a â€œheavenâ€ (which too doesnÂ´t fit into the true existential theory) is stupid unless itÂ´s akin to a hobby/sport where you do it for doing itÂ´s sake. Same thing with the â€œheaven hates hamâ€-thing â€“ when you know enough science (enough = what IÂ´ve written so far in this text) youÂ´ll realize that the whole ham-prohibition is man-made (from the bronze age) and linked to some pre-scientific nonsense from-the-horseÂ´s-mouth-
statement (canÂ´t say rationale because itÂ´s dogma). If you (and secondarily your peers) are dedicated to nonsense (whether it be sports, stamp-collecting, memorizing capitals or not eating pork), then do it if it does something good like prove to yourself (and others) that you have a strong discipline (even though your effort is misdirected toward nonsense). I can invent a ritual and do it every day, and maybe IÂ´d feel pride over that I can keep to a schedule of nonsense, but I would never claim the theory that there is a talking God, and by extention I wouldnÂ´t say that that ficticious talker prohibited ham. The mundane action must be differentiated from the logical argument. Ham-prohibitions and talking Gods are artifacts that belong in the past â€“ modern white A4-paper is too beautiful for someone to write something as erroneous as â€œthere is a talking Godâ€ on it. But as IÂ´m writing this, people are dying because religion binds them together (and frustrates them, and boosts their war-morale in many ways). My work can cause a civil war within ISIS â€“ a civil rift so permiating that only family ties, friendships and common goals (to get money, not to spread islam) can keep people together in groups. Once my existential theory is known there will still be crime and instability in Iraq, Syria and Afghanistan, but the evil deeds will only be committed by groups of 2-3 people â€“ not 20 000 of them. The binding effect of the Quran can most clearly be seen in that internet-propaganda made Quran-readers from the USA and Europe go fight in Syria â€“ everyone wants a group and itÂ´s totally human to assume that knowing the same book will be enough for a bond to be as strong as one wants it to be.
Right now â€œmy workâ€ is 9 proper texts and a few videos. They all talk about the same thing (which can be formulated as: IÂ´ll say as much as I can about things IÂ´ve never heard anyone else say (and IÂ´ve seen the best professors in the world teaching truths)). To cause a rift in the taliban/ISIS and stop the war by making group-bonding (around a holy book) problematic/impossible, my whole â€œworkâ€ doesnÂ´t need to be dropped as propaganda books on top of ISIS and the taliban. ItÂ´s enough that the news headlines say that â€œa correct all-explaining existential theory has been found â€“ religions in crysisâ€ or that enough people know my theory so that a multitude of youtube videos are made where, in a sentence or two, the presenter goes off-topic and mentions why we exist / something from my theory. Having understood it once makes it impossible to forget â€“ having understood it once makes group-bonding over religion (which fuels ISIS/the taliban/etc) impossible. If the world could just take 20 minutes of itsÂ´ time to spend on explaining/teaching/arguing my work/theory, then the war on terror would be over â€“ otherwise it will persist as long as people have no actual, logical theory about their existence and thus believe in bronze-age marketing tricks.
â€”â€”-
The theory of evolution begins with the first reproducing shape. It was a shape that assembled surrounding mass into a similar shape. The existential theory predicts the existence of infinitely many such shapes. What inevitable becomes true when you have reproduction is that some die and some survive (life and death), that the number of offspring that shape make matters and that there is mutations over time. This is true about the shapeÂ´s offspring: some will die and some will survive, the number of offspring they make matters and the offspring can be different from the original shape. These three rules / laws of nature were inactive before the first reproduction occurred. The next main event was that one of these shapes found that if it injected its DNA into other shapesÂ´ reproductive mechanism, it exploited principle number two: that the number of offspring matters. It was the first virus: it hijacked othersÂ´ reproduction. The rule / law of nature that came into play with this event was that â€œpowerâ€ matters: hijacking othersÂ´ reproductive mechanism gives evolutionary benefits. Now weÂ´ve listed the four main rules that govern evolutionary theory: first came the three first, and then came the forth: power. The next main event â€“ to guard against viruses taking over all life / reproductive mechanisms â€“ was that an immune system evolved to protect against virusÂ´ hijack attempts. This required multicellularism. Just like immune systems prompt/require multicellularism, immune systems prompt/require multigenderedism: to win in the arms race against quickly mutating viruses two genders arose to amplify the mutations to the immune system. Mixing genes from two genders creates a more mutated immune system, which can keep ahead in the arms race against quickly-mutating viruses â€œtryingâ€ to mutate to bypass any immune system. The next main event is that one of these multicellular organisms â€“ a fish or worm â€“ of the male gender mutated to be agressive and defeat other males in battle. He wouldÂ´ve gotten access to many more females than his non-agressive counter-parts. This too can be called â€œpowerâ€ because the agressive male hijacks other maleÂ´s access to females by killing the males. This prompts the dinosaurs because larger muscle mass and shaper weaponry is better at killing off competitors. Amongst the dinosaurs there was the mother-offspring bond, placed there by evolution for the evolutionary benefits a mother gets from seeing an offspring survive to adulthood. This bond mutated to involve flock-members because a group working together out-competes any individualists when fighting over anything. The next main event was that someone mapped the flock, in his brain, as a hierarchy (up-down-axis) with the longing to dominate peers.

Dude, evolution has me try to maximize evolutionary benefits using my plans; im always thinking at full speed and pain drives that thinking. And i know for certain that all this pain is meaningless. Its a suicide recipe but what prevents me from suicide is the natural strength that stems from being the pinnacle of beasts who all have survived for generations.

New book 2017
Chapter 1:
What problem does this solve?
This solves a problem that becomes most visible 60 years from now when sea-levels rise, the economy goes into permanent decline and oil ends. ThatÂ´s when humans start to fight (and belong in world-view-based groups to do so). While the economy is still rising the clashes are few and far between â€“ Afghanistan, Syria, ISISÂ´ world-wide terror attacks (mainly muslim world-views clashing with tolerant world-views). When the economy starts declining thereÂ´ll naturally be more friction between groups, and groups are made up of world-views (people identify as in a group based on world-view).
Advancing the scientific world-view to the level where it explains our origin and thus invades religious intellectual turf, solves the problem of world-views colliding as war.
Chapter 2:
Certain truth â€“ I think & I am
You have a composite certain truth consisting of two certain truths: you can claim as certain that you think (because if you were being fooled: being fooled is thinking) and that you exist (because being fooled requires the one who is fooled to be there). I think and I exist is one statement but two truths. You can certainly claim to have â€œdistinctionâ€ because youÂ´re dealing with multiple separate distinct entities (such as â€œIâ€ and â€œthoughtâ€). One could put it, while seeing the certain truths â€œI thinkâ€ and â€œI existâ€, that the space between the two notions (thinker and thought) is the hallmark of distinction. The distance separating thinker from thought we can recognize as necessary for â€œdistinctionâ€ to be concluded as a certain truth arising, in a next logical step, from the original primary certain truth.
Everyone agrees they they themselves exist, because if one would get fooled in everyone one can be fooled in then one would exist there anyway and be fooled. So one knows that one exists. Then one also knows that one thinks because â€œto get fooledâ€ is a thought-process. Thus we have two things: I think and I exist. And the distinction between them: and on the flipside of the paper we have the opposite of that: anti-distinction, and this can also be called â€œthat of which all is partâ€/Reality. And since we are in the distinction-side of the paper when we see something; when we see something there is distinction between us and that thing. Thus we cannot represent or see that which is on the other side of the paper i.e. that of which all is part / Reality. Nothing can represent â€“ because it is distinct â€“ Reality. So whatever which is distinct cannotâ€¦ whatever that is observed or represented is distinct and therefore is notâ€¦ therefore does not represent Reality / â€œthat of which all is partâ€. So we have distinction and anti-distinction as opposing poles.
You have a certain truth which everyone in the whole world agrees upon. You think and you exist since if you were being fooled by an almighty demon youÂ´d still both think and exist. Then there are two things i.e. distinction. All is part of a single reality which is anti-distinction, there are no separate parts: reality is one. If we put distinction on the left side of the paper and anti-distinction on the right side then (we) distinction cannot see that of which all is part because â€œto seeâ€ is â€œto representâ€ and then one uses something to refer to reality. There is nothing outside reality which can refer to reality but instead reality is defined as â€œthat of which all is partâ€ and then there is nothing that can refer to all of reality. The opposition between the two sides of the paper (distinction & anti-distinction) makes reality as â€œthat of which all is partâ€-anti-distinction non-representable because representation always involves distinction. What we see, for example, is just parts of reality. The hypotheses can be infinitely much so there is infinitely much to reality. Sizes and times, that is. In the existential theory (â€œwhy we existâ€) there, thus, is an infinite size-range with time, energymass in spacetime (everything and nothing intertwined like in the E=mc2 equation â€“ energy equals mass times, well â€“ spacetime; multiplication is what unites energymass with spacetime). Then we have distinction and anti-distinction: separate things but all is part of a single reality. The existential theory with its three pillars, that is an infinite sizerange, energymasspacetime and distinction-anti-distinction-opposition, predicts that there should be a tiny piece of DNA which copies itself.
Then thereÂ´s another kind of revelation that got respect. Descartes who lived in the 1600s got respect, fame and was invited to live with the Queen of Sweden because he had gotten an idea which certainly told us something true. Revelations can either be con menÂ´s statements like they were from ape-man and forward, or they can actually claim something which is verifyably true. Descartes, propably having his mind overcrowded by the masses of revelations that had accumulated to his time, asked: â€œwhat would be true if all my statements were false?â€. What would remain if I tossed all my knowledge and ideas into the trash? Are we stuck with countless unverifyable statements, some contradicting eachother, not knowing which ones are true and which ones are not? Obviously not since statements about architecture are obviously true since they build houses, while contradictory statements do not. So Descartes dared to throw all his knowledge in the trash to see what remained. He found certain truth: that he exists â€“ because even if he was wrong or was being fooled in everything he thought to be true, thereÂ´d still be a â€œheâ€ there. He certainly exists no matter what. Same thing goes for thoughts: being wrong or being fooled is a thinking-process so even if he was wrong or was being fooled in everything he thought, thereÂ´d still be thought.
Socrates: So he figured out that he thinks and he exists.
God: These are not one statement â€“ they are two.
Socrates: What does that mean?
God: IÂ´ll tell you later â€“ just agree with me that there is distinction between thinker and thought â€“ that the statements are two. ItÂ´s building on certain truth, and itÂ´s possible to build a wholeâ€¦ whatever it is that â€œsaves the worldâ€ from the coming economic decline by having everyone build on certain truth until the God-debate is settled. Remembering â€œdistinctionâ€ (between thinker and thought) will prevent the horror-scenario of large-scale future wars between people group-bound by religions, and instead â€“ since everyone built a whole world-view on certain truth â€“ have a more stable decline in the future. â€œDistinctionâ€ i.e. remembering that there are two certain truths (thinker and thought) is a step on the way toward a plan that will save humanity from destroying itself as much as it would if we didnÂ´t build our world-views on certain truth.
Plato: So after an era of â€œrevelationâ€-revelations invented by anyone for whatever purpose, coming from DarwinÂ´s ape-manÂ´s revelations, Descartes, in the 1600s, invented a revelation â€“ certain truth: I think and I exist â€“ which got him invited to the Queen of Sweden for the rest of his life. People have always liked revelations and even verifyable truth-claims like DescartesÂ´ get respect.
God: I have set it as true that each one of you humans can verify in your own mindÂ´s eye that you do certainly exist and that there certainly is thought â€“ and thus there is distinction.
Darwin: Distinction is an abstract word. That two objects are separate/different from one another is one of those notions and ape-man never made into language â€“ there was never the evolutionary need to talk about â€œdistinctionâ€. Yes: one could say that one banana is different from another (and one wants the bigger one), but to have Distinction exist stand-alone as a distinct notion is abstract thinking and we are not evolved to do that. For millions of years the caveman word for â€œdistinctionâ€ was only used in a sentance â€“ not stand-alone as in â€œdistinction certainly exists because thinker and thought are both certain truthsâ€.
Chapter 3:
Distinction-antidistinction-opposition
The first proof for that the size-time-diagram is infinite is distinctionÂ´s (our) inability to see/represent anti-distinction.
Chapter 4:
Maximum size?
The second prooof for that the size-time-diagram is infinite is that if we imagine a partless anti-distinction then it has no distinction as in a â€œmaximumâ€ or â€œminimumâ€ size, i.e. the size-range is infinite.
Chapter 5:
Infinite size-time-diagram

Existential theoryÂ´s 3 pillars

Previous atheists have moved God from a place where do intervenes in everyday life using miracles, to a God that set everything in motion but then doesnÂ´t intervene. My philosophy places God as a bum who watches a skyscraper get built â€“ the bum then gets praised for the skyscraper getting built even though the bum didnÂ´t contribute anything: at most he watched as other mechanisms got everything done.
Or God is a football fan who cheers at the players but doesnÂ´t himself contribute to making goals. Natural mechanisms create the world â€“ no need to praise God.
You know for certain that you think and that you exist because even if an almighty demon was fooling you in everything you can possibly be fooled in, the fooling itself is a thought-process and therefore you know that thought exists (you think), and for you to be fooled you have to exist and therefore you know "I exist". Being fooled is thinking and a thinker is necessary for there to be someone to be fooled. So you know: no matter what, you think and you exist. Those are two things, right? TheyÂ´re both part of the same brain and the thought-process can become the analytical toolkit/thinker, but still we recognize that there are distinct entities - there is distinction. This can also be called separation. What is distinctionÂ´s opposite, anti-distinction? ItÂ´s one reality; that of which all is part; itÂ´s one and realityÂ´s definition in the dictionary is that all is part of it. If we write distinction (thinker and thought) on the left side of the paper and anti-distinction (reality; that of which all is part; one) on the right side of the paper - can the left side see the right side? No, because of opposition between distinction and anti-distinction. Because of there always being an observer (a thinker) and thus distinction in every observation and thus anti-distinction canÂ´t be represented/seen.
The brain evolved to deal with natural occurances - there was never an event in history where something invisible was to be contemplated and dealt with. Thus we seem to assume that the thought-process went wrong when we say that distinction/us canÂ´t see anti-distinction/reality. But the thought-process didnÂ´t go wrong: all that it means is that there is more to reality than can be represented. Regardless of how vaguely "represents" is defined, say a coffee cup - regardless of brains being involved - is assumed to try to represent that of which all is part, then anti-dinstinction - distinction - opposition (the opposition between distinction and itÂ´s opposite) makes the representation incorrect. We can ask if there in an anti-distinct "thing" is a maximum size and thus distinction? No. Likewise, another proof for that the size-range is infinite is that we do sense something (our everyday world) and can make hypotheses ad infinitum, and yet nothing represent
s ALL OF reality. Reality i.e. s
ize-time thus is infinite.
The infinite size-range is one pillar in the existential theory. Another pillar is energymass and spacetime being opposites but intertwined as in E=mc
2
(where c
2
refers to a speed which is space over time: spacetime). Multiplication joins energymass together with spacetime; nothing together with something/everything; existence together with non-existence. Why is there existence the shape of my body? Without going into the historical answer, one can explain it by saying that the body is something in (intertwined with) nothing, of a size in an infinite size-range (where the relationship between any two sizes (or objects of two sizes) i
s that they make sense of i.e. j
ustify one another). Then there too, as a third pillar, is distinction-
an
ti-distinction-opposition i.e. w
e live in a single (not plural) reality but we see distinct/separate entities such as thinker and thought.
Speaking of spacetime, spacetime is the logical starting point for the time-based existential theory.
Nothingness (empty space) needs n
o prior justification nor reason to exist, because it doesnÂ´t exist. In it, however
, laws of nature are true i.e. i
t is not irrational / anti-logical, and among the many laws of nature there are those, including E=mc
2
, which mention energymass. Could energymass be "mentioned" without it existing? If yes, it would be absurd / anti-logical. Why would reality mention things that never exist? But since laws of nature are firm and because of our rule "what is mentioned must exist or must be summoned" we get, wherever (in the smallest spaces) that E=mc
2
is mentioned, existence and thus dense existence: a big bang. The fact that galaxies are speeding away acceleratingly from one another leads to nothingness in the future, and with the middleman "laws of nature" again energymass is summoned as dense as can be. No time-delay between nothingness - laws of nature - energymass but as soon as a bordered (by event horizons which are determined by the finite speed of light) region becomes nothingness, a big bang occurs and eventually becomes nothingness bordered by event horizons again. This is the time-wise description of why energymass (which exists intertwined with spacetime as in E=mc
2
) starts dense and becomes nothingness, and repeats.
All of the above is a rival theory to "God created earth in 6 days and rested on the 7th". It is unintuitive because it deals with things we didnÂ´t have to deal with in evolution: invisible energymasspacetime/reality/anti-distinction as a part of reasoning. It also has a multi-reason cause for our existence: a time-wise rationale involving the beginning and end of the big bang combined with a 3-pillar existential theory which justifies size and energymass. It is abstract/scientific but canÂ´t be reduced into simpler terms. ItÂ´s the lowest common denominator that everyone can believe in (regardless of religion).
How many is reality? One. How many is Allah? One. Can anything completely represent reality? No. Can anything completely represent Allah? No. Is reality the greatest (if all is part of it)? Yes. Is â€œAllah akbarâ€? Yes. Reality and Allah have these three things incommon â€“ so maybe reality is synonymous with Allah?
How vaguely has reality defined â€to representâ€?
Infinitely vaguely â€“ anything can represent anything.
Is the representation/representer reality or Allah?
No.
Can anything represent that of which all is part?
No.
Then the size-time-diagram is infinite i.e. nothing represents reality. How many is it? How many is Allah? 1.
Did it sayâ€¦, or did it wri
te a book?
This disproves Allah writing the Quran.
Again: how much of reality can be represented by, say, a painting? The whole of it?
No, the whole of reality cannot be represented. Just like Allah canÂ´t be captured in a picture/word.
We can have hypotheses â€“ how many hypotheses can we have?
If reality is sizes & times, energymass and spacetime then the square-shaped size-time-diagram with energymasspacetime in each coordinate is the universal way to represent all there is to represent.
Does it write books? No, it is not of such authorship-kind nature.
â€œGod said to Muhammed word by wordâ€¦â€ is thus a false or at most metaphorical statement.
â€œYou have to do rituals in order not to go to hell, and in heaven you get 72 virginsâ€ is by the same logic also a false claim.
There are three alternatives as the foundation for this logic â€“ can you think of a 4
th
one?
1: Reality is a synonym for Allah
2: or Allah doesnÂ´t exist
3: or there are 72 virgins (not an alternative because reality is not of the nature, because it is size-time-energymasspacetime, to write books).
In addition to the square size-time diagram with infinity symbols in each of itÂ´s corners, and the evolutionary triangle which designates that life becomes more complex as time goes on
(the triangle originates at the central size of the known size-range), there is the following brain diagram:
You have a composite certain truth consisting of two certain truths: you can claim as certain that you think (because if you were being fooled: being fooled is thinking) and that you exist (because being fooled requires the one who is fooled to be there). I think and I exist is one statement but two truths. You can certainly claim to have â€œdistinctionâ€ because youÂ´re dealing
with multiple separate distinct entities (such as â€œIâ€ and â€œthoughtâ€). One could put it, while seeing the certain truths â€œI thinkâ€ and â€œI existâ€, that the space between the two notions (thinker and thought) is the hallmark of distinction. The distance separating thinker from thought we can recognize as necessary for â€œdistinctionâ€ to be concluded as a certain truth arising, in a next logical step, from the original primary certain truth.
Are all distinct entities part of a single reality if â€œrealityâ€ is defined as â€œthat of which all is partâ€? In other words: if we draw distinction on the left side of a paper and anti-distinction (distinctionÂ´s opposite: a singular reality â€“ that of which all is part. Zooming out summarizing maximally) on the right side of the paper, then can distinction represent the right side of the paper i.e. anti-distinction? How could some distinct entities depict the very opposite of what representation/distinction is? Any depiction/representation of anti-distinction/reality has at least three entities: thinker, space between thinker and thought, and thought. Separation/distinction is inherent in representation, thus anti-distinction is unrepresentable.
How vaguely has the universe/God defined what a representation is i.e. when a representation occurs? Our brains use neurons to represent, but what if â€“ instead of neurons (regardless of brains) â€“ the universe wills that any random object can be said to, as neurons do, represent reality? The universe has defined â€œrepresentationâ€ infinitely vaguely i.e. disregarding brains, any random object spontaneously is the symbol standing for all of reality â€“ because the universe defines â€œrepresentsâ€ infinitely vaguely. Despite the infinitely vague definition of what represents what, distinction-anti-distinction-opposition (the line separating the left side of the paper from the right side; the countering of distinction with anti-distinction) means that reality is not representable. If reality is anti-distinction then no distinction (representation is inherently distinction) can even, despite an infinitely vague definition of â€œrepresentsâ€, capture reality.
In
representations we can count at least three things and what weÂ´re trying to capture is one thing with nothing outside it. The fact that representations contain distinction makes capturing reality (all is one) impossible.
We can have infinitely many or infinitely large/substancefull representations/hypotheses â€“ such as an infinite size-time-diagram â€“ and though abstractly accurately pointing to reality, the universeÂ´s rule that nothing represents reality despite infinitely vaguely allowed representations of infinitely much, makes reality unrepresentable. This can only mean one thing: reality â€“ which we know as sizes and times (a size-time-diagram) â€“ is infinite. ThereÂ´s infinitely large and infinitely small with infinitely much past and infinitely much future. This square-shaped size-time-diagram i.e. our everyday experience of size-time has infinities all-over the place.
Energymass in spacetime: one in zero, existence in non-existence, something in nothing â€“ as defined by E=mc
2
where c
2
stands for speed (distance over time i.e. spacetime/zero/non-existence) and E=m referring to energymass (existence, something, all).
Distinction-anti-distinction-opposition: we live in a singular reality but we see multiple objects.
An infinite size-range.
The above three ideas are an existential theory (a theory which explains the existence of a reproducing shape and thus the dawn of evolution and thus our existence). It is modern to utilize three equal ideas to explain oneÂ´s existence â€“ all previous existential theories used either a single idea (monotheism) or a saga (multiple mundane (not very scientific/abstract) ideas) to explain existence.
The predictive quality that makes this existential theory a scientific theory is that it, basing it off an infinite size-range of energymasspacetime and distinction-anti-distinction-opposition, predicts that in an infinite size-range there ought to be a size where reproduction occurs. The existential theory predicts the first DNA, and from there we get to the evolutionary theory.
Another predictive quality is that the theory predicts a
dense
Big Bang. The a priori beginning of the universe logically is emptiness because emptiness doesnÂ´t need any prior logical justification for its existence because it doesnÂ´t exist. In emptiness laws of nature are true, such as the laws pointing toward and handleing energymass (like E=mc
2
), and thus the Big Bang begins infinitely dense because E=mc
2
is equally true simultaneously in the smallest of spaces. Tiny empty spaces having E=mc
2
be true in them simultaneously and directly as there was nothingness predicts a dense Big Bang. A region, contained within event horizons made out of energymasses speeding away at >c (due to dark energy causing accelerating cosmic expansion), is by definition â€œnothingâ€ in which E=mc
2
being true in the tiniest spaces summons a dense big bang out of reach of the closest (v = >c) energymass. Nothingness (out of reach for the closest energymasses because they are speeding away at >c) is summoned in the central point with event horizons as the furthest away border, causing Big Bang (due to laws of nature summoning energymass in the empty center).
The theory of evolution begins with the first reproducing shape. It was a shape that assembled surrounding mass into a similar shape. The existential theory predicts the existence of infinitely many such shapes. What inevitable becomes true when you have reproduction is that some die and some survive (life and death), that the number of offspring that shape make matters and that there is mutations over time. This is true about the shapeÂ´s offspring: some will die and some will survive, the number of offspring they make matters and the offspring can be different from the original shape. These three rules / laws of nature were inactive before the first reproduction occurred. The next main event was that one of these shapes found that if it injected its DNA into other shapesÂ´ reproductive mechanism, it exploited principle number two: that the number of offspring matters. It was the first virus: it hijacked othersÂ´ reproduction. The rule / law of nature that came into play with this event was that "power" matters: hijacking othersÂ´ reproductive mechanism gives evolutionary benefits. Now weÂ´ve listed the four main rules that govern evolutionary theory: first came the three first, and then came the forth: power. The next main event - to guard against viruses taking over all life / reproductive mechanisms - was that an immune system evolved to protect against virusÂ´ hijack attempts. This required multicellularism. Just like immune systems prompt/require multicellularism, immune systems prompt/require multigenderedism: to win in the arms race against quickly mutating viruses two genders arose to amplify the mutations to the immune system. Mixing genes from two genders creates a more mutated immune system, which can keep ahead in the arms race against quickly-mutating viruses "trying" to mutate to bypass any immune system. The next main event is that one of these multicellular organisms - a fish or worm - of the male gender mutated to be ag
g
ressive and defeat other males in battle. He wouldÂ´ve gotten access to many more females than his non-ag
g
ressive counter-parts. This too can be called "power" because the ag
g
ressive male hijacks other maleÂ´s access to females by killing the males. This prompts the dinosaurs because larger muscle mass and shaper weaponry is better at killing off competitors. Amongst the dinosaurs there was the mother-offspring bond, placed there by evolution for the evolutionary benefits a mother gets from seeing an offspring survive to adulthood. This bond mutated to involve flock-members because a group working together out-competes any individualists when fighting over anything. The next main event was that someone mapped the flock, in his brain, as a hierarchy (up-down-axis) with the longing to
be the top of the hierarchy. This capitalist striving for
the top made brains grew larger
â€“ larger memory-banks, more accurate predictions and faster planning are all advantages coming from a larger cortex.
It is a major historical event that there finally is an atheistic argument that is sh
aped like a university course: i
t is an existential theory plus evolution which not only doesnÂ´t need a personified god to function, but the pillars (infinite sizerange of energymasspacetime and distinction-anti-distinction-opposition) canÂ´t have a personified god added to them as a 4th pillar without the theory sounding ridicilous. Not only does the theory not need a personified god but adding a god destroys the minimalistic rationally complete beauty of the theory. Gods uglify the theory. The dawn of the theory is a major historical event because never before has an entire course (beginning with certain truth, going through the existential theory and ending in evolution) been laid out in the intellectual debate of atheism, as an argument against a personified god.
The anatomy in the brain from hearing certain truth (I think & I am) - the beginning of the course - creates the same neuronal pathways / associations between ideas in every single person who knows certain truth. The logical step to "distinction" is noting, as a meta-analysis of the primary certain truth, that one has many ideas (I think AND I am) and that one can take logical pathways to the next step in the course (distinction exists). Then juxtaposing anti-distinction with distinction creates the unseeable - "defying reason" (because reason is, in simple people, only visual) - conclusion that we/distinction cannot see reality/anti-distinction. The distinction-anti-distinction-opposition is hard to grasp because it - like formal logic or math - uses words instead of pictures (the linguistic brainhalf rather than the visual one). We evolved to be like "if I see it I believe it" and that was a good heuristic (rule of thumb) because practical sequences of events can be verified as true or untrue by visualizing them. But in this philosophy: no - it has to be linguistic that we deny ourselves the concept "all of reality", leading to the conclusion that there is more to reality than anything - however vaguely the universe has defined "represent" - can represent. This adds infinitely many sizes to our abstract size-range / size-time-diagram; it makes a square (with size on the y-axis and time on the x-axis) with infinity symbols in each corner, which in turn becomes a pillar in our personified-god-denying existential theory.
To come from certain truth, through mere logical steps (meta-analyses and juxtaposition of opposites), to an existential theory which predicts evolution is a major historical event in the history of atheism.
In a historical context the anatomy (neural connections between ideas and sequences of logic) created by this course is like a paradigm-shift into a new era of earth society - an era similar to that existent on infinitely many other planets who have come further than our midway-mark in a regular water-bearing planetÂ´s history.
Evolution, by beginning with "a mass that can assemble surrounding mass into a similar shape" steps forth from the existential theoryÂ´s infinite size-range of energymasspacetime. Assuming DNA is the replication-molecule, we can step - skipping over how cell walls evolved etc - to the fact that viruses mutate to hijack othersÂ´ reproductive system. This - in this universal inter-planetary extraterrestrial culture - is formulated, in books of logic, as first three rules arising (life/death, number of offspring matters and "there is mutation in each generation-shift") and then a forth rule arising (power, with viruses). This story - which in our course begins from a first reproducing shape and ends with finessing the anatomy of power in men - is visualizable like the caveman story-telling narratives we evolved to hear/see. We can proof-check its validity/possibility by following the narrative visually. The visual nature of evolution is in stark contrast to the purely linguistic/abstract nature of the existential theory.
Speaking o
f "abstract" descriptions i.e. d
escriptions that make it very clear to us that our understanding of the universe is a mere map (a reference) and not reality itself (mind you of PlatoÂ´s or KantÂ´s cave-metaphor and "the thing is not the thing itself" -philosophies)... The size-range of energymasspacetime,
at the size of quantum physics
has us describe photons etc using both the wave-description which focu
s
es on lengths of space (this is the "spacetime description") AND - in wave-particle duality - the energymass description that the energy of a photon is its color. Color (as perceived through the eyes), wave/spacetime-description and particle-energy/energymass-description all are valid descriptors of quantum particles. This ability of ours to describe any mass/phenomenon using both energymass- and spacetime-descriptions runs throughout the entire size-range. You can imagine two lines - one representing energymass and the other representing spacetime - running vertically through the pictures on the size-axis. Adding complexity to this, there is likewise two lines - gravity and electromagnetism - both running through the size-axis, gravity having itÂ´s duality of energymass and spacetime descriptions and electromagnetism too having both, in every level of the size-range, energymass and spacetime descriptions. Gravity is both Newtonian "masses pulling toward masses" (energymassÂ´ focus on mass) and Einsteinian "curvature of spacetime" (spacetimeÂ´s focus on space) - both descriptors are accurate.
We are half-way in a planetÂ´s history â€“ 4.5 billion years have passed and 5 billion remain. The theory you now know is, in other words, in cosmic majority â€“ more planets have it than not (if it takes approximately half of a planetÂ´s history to invent it and if it remains true for the rest of the planetÂ´s history). Most other planets i.e. the majority of extraterrestrials are ideological adherents of the theory. Spread this theory to get approval of the majority even though it lives light-years away. Currently 99.9% of the worldÂ´s population lives in the era of religions â€“ spread this theory to end religious wars and terrorism like 9/11. The world-view (the view/diagrams that explain the world) is the same in the cosmic majority.
IÂ´ve worked 10 years to invent this theory and as alone bearing it itÂ´s my responsibility that it spreads. The future civilization in which everyone has the same world-view thus is dependent on me. I feel a
unique ability to influence earthÂ´s future.
You, as one who has partaken of this rare knowledge, should also feel a responsibility about spreading it to change the world.
IÂ´ve talked about the emotional repertoire in the brain-diagram. If we were to genetically engineer (DNA-manipulate) a next generation, we would A) give it an incredible sense of humor and knowledge so it could entertain us, and/or B) make it a super-happy retard â€“ retarded because positive emotions donÂ´t motivate â€“ they pacify â€“ so super-happy is equal to looking like a mongoloid; needs and wants and everything that drives us is painful â€“ pain motivates while super-happiness pacifies. We would, by creating these DNA-engineered emotional repertoires (to accomplish the dual goal of incredible happiness and incredible entertainers/comedians/philosophers), be doing something that is done on other planets â€“ these are universal engineering goals. I need money to accomplish this project. If you wish to contribute, contact yonis1@gmail.com
You know that gold plate we sent up into space for aliens to find? It had etched on it images of man, some music, some other picturesâ€¦ We didnÂ´t send up the diagram discussed in this book. If the aliens see the gold plate we did send up, theyÂ´ll read between the lines â€“ seeing that there is no universal diagram â€“ and conclude that: â€œon earth they still believe in godsâ€.
You know how most people dedicate a large part of their lives to religion? Once they understand my tattoo (diagram) theyÂ´ll ask themselves: â€œwhat the hell have I been praying to?â€ It resembles a tiny needle popping a big balloon.
If this book goes mainstream, the future becomes so interesting that one forgets oneÂ´s everyday problems.
Interesting important things relieve
anxiety
(especially when they contain humor like a universal tattoo).
Nazis were friends with Nazis, communists were friends with communists, USA was friends with USA, when jihadists meet they share the same ideology and thus bond quickly. My
theory/ideology/religion-replacer is empathy-increasing.
The more things people agree upon the better.
In the diagram/tattoo there are about 16 â€œlinesâ€ (hundreds if we consider the emotional repertoire being drawn the same on other planets). The sport is to draw as many universal lines as possible â€“ drawn from science so they can be drawn from science anywhere in the infinite universe.
God is a war-motivator. They say â€œthere are no atheists in trenchholesâ€. You need a bit of God to do war.
ItÂ´s hard to be an atheist warrior. My book, by disproving god, thus makes motivation for war less.
Gods contribute nothing â€“ one will have the full human experience-repertoire without gods.
Rather no direction than the wrong direction â€“ gods only contribute to war; itÂ´s better to be tolerantly caveman, uncaring of ideologies/world-views, than to be religious.
It seems mean to say that â€œitÂ´s their fault that religious wars keep on going â€“ those that wonÂ´t studyâ€, but itÂ´s good marketing.
Accomplices.
From having read this book, the following should now be understandable:
Certain truth leads to the conclusion â€œdistinctionâ€, and simultaneously warrants an anti-distinction defined as â€œthat of which all is partâ€. The opposition between distinction and anti-distinction â€“ despite â€œrepresentationâ€ being ubiquitous (infinitely vaguely defined) â€“ together with the â€œmax size?â€-question asked in anti-distinction â€“ supports the fact that reality i.e. size-time is infinite. This then becomes our pillar in our existential theory that moves God away from a creator role. The two other pillars are energimasspacetime (found in E=mc
2
) and the opposition that we live in a singular reality yet see multiple things. From the middle of the known size-range (which itself is part of the infinite size-range) comes the tip of a triangle which symbolizes evolution. From evolution, then, comes the brain diagram with dopamine & serotonin across the visual and linguistic brainhalves, and a lower box which is our 3-category emotional repertoire; the most common 4 emotions in our idle society being power-hungryness (how to elevate oneself in the socioeconomic hierarchy if one is a man; and for females itÂ´s mapping the status-hierarchy of men in their social group as to find them differently attractive), expanding oneÂ´s world-view, planning sex and planning resource-gathering/work.
This makes for a multi-symbol diagram involving the existential theoryÂ´s three pillars holding up the square-triangle-brain (size-time-diagram, evolution, brain) diagram.
Certain truth is or leads to distinction, which itself â€“ as all distinct things are â€“ is part of anti-distinction.
This is like saying obvious things about the reality/everyday world in front of us: such as that size is infinite and that it is something in nothing. All this, in turn, leads us to draw a square: a size-time diagram with infinity-symbols in all 4 corners. From the middle of the known size-range,
then, comes a triangle â€“ evolution â€“ which ends up in the brain with serotonine, dopamine, two brainhalves, a cortex and an emotional repertoire (upper- and lower box). In the emotional repertoire there are 4 idle emotions, among them â€œseeking powerâ€ â€“ power here is defined as outcompeting other males (if oneself is male) in a status competition, but the principle of diminishing other malesÂ´ reproductive capabilities happened at several stages in evolution: males fighting males (growing bigger to become dinosaurs) or viruses hijacking reproductive mechanisms of single-celled organisms.
The search for power thus has led to brain-size growing (when competing for upwardness in hierarchies) but also things like T-rexÂ´s claws or the 1918 flu â€“ not to mention war.

Important Semi-Book 2017
The text begins with certain truth, goes on to explaining why something exists rather than nothing (the existential theory â€“ why we exist), and then goes on to evolutionary theory which is predicted by the existential theory and explains everday occurances.
You know for certain that you think and that you exist because even if an almighty demon was fooling you in everything you can possibly be fooled in, the fooling itself is a thought-process and therefore you know that thought exists (you think), and for you to be fooled you have to exist and therefore you know â€œI existâ€. Being fooled is thinking and a thinker is necessary for there to be someone to be fooled. So you know: no matter what, you think and you exist. Those are two things, right? TheyÂ´re both part of the same brain and the thought-process can become the analytical toolkit/thinker, but still we recognize that there are distinct entities â€“ there is distinction. This can also be called separation. What is distinctionÂ´s opposite, anti-distinction? ItÂ´s one reality; that of which all is part; itÂ´s one and realityÂ´s definition in the dictionary is that all is part of it. If we write distinction (thinker and thought) on the left side of the paper and anti-distinction (reality; that of which all is part; one) on the right side of the paper â€“ can the left side see the right side? No, because of opposition between distinction and anti-distinction. Because of there always being an observer (a thinker) and thus distinction in every observation and thus anti-distinction canÂ´t be represented/seen.
The brain evolved to deal with natural occurances â€“ there was never an event in history where something invisible was to be contemplated and dealt with. Thus we seem to assume that the thought-process went wrong when we say that distinction/us canÂ´t see anti-distinction/reality. But the thought-process didnÂ´t go wrong: all that it means is that there is more to reality than can be represented. Regardless of how vaguely â€œrepresentsâ€ is defined, say a coffee cup â€“ regardless of brains being involved â€“ is assumed to try to represent that of which all is part, then anti-dinstinction â€“ distinction â€“ opposition (the opposition between distinction and itÂ´s opposite) makes the representation incorrect. We can ask if there in an anti-distinct â€œthingâ€ is a maximum size and thus distinction? No. Likewise, another proof for that the size-range is infinite is that we do sense something (our everyday world) and can make hypotheses ad infinitum, and yet nothing represents ALL OF reality. Reality i.e. size-time thus is infinite.
The infinite size-range is one pillar in the existential theory. Another pillar is energymass and spacetime being opposites but intertwined as in E=mc
2
(where c
2
refers to a speed which is space over time: spacetime). Multiplication joins energymass together with spacetime; nothing together with something/everything; existence together with non-existence. Why is there existence the shape of my body? Without going into the historical answer, one can explain it by saying that the body is something in (intertwined with) nothing, of a size in an infinite size-range (where the relationship between any two sizes (or objects of two sizes) is that they make sense of i.e. justify one another). Then there too, as a third pillar, is distinction-anti-distinction-opposition i.e. we live in a single (not plural) reality but we see distinct/separate entities such as thinker and thought.
Speaking of spacetime, spacetime is the logical starting point for the time-based existential theory. Nothingness (empty space) needs no prior justification nor reason to exist, because it doesnÂ´t exist. In it, however, laws of nature are true i.e. it is not irrational / anti-logical, and among the many laws of nature there are those, including E=mc
2
, which mention energymass. Could energymass be â€œmentionedâ€ without it existing? If yes, it would be absurd / anti-logical. Why would reality mention things that never exist? But since laws of nature are firm and because of our rule â€œwhat is mentioned must exist or must be summonedâ€ we get, wherever (in the smallest spaces) that E=mc
2
is mentioned, existence and thus dense existence: a big bang. The fact that galaxies are speeding away acceleratingly from one another leads to nothingness in the future, and with the middleman â€œlaws of natureâ€ again energymass is summoned as dense as can be. No time-delay between nothingness â€“ laws of nature â€“ energymass but as soon as a bordered (by event horizons which are determined by the finite speed of light) region becomes nothingness, a big bang occurs and eventually becomes nothingness bordered by event horizons again. This is the time-wise description of why energymass (which exists intertwined with spacetime as in E=mc
2
) starts dense and becomes nothingness, and repeats.
All of the above is a rival theory to â€œGod created earth in 6 days and rested on the 7thâ€. It is unintuitive because it deals with things we didnÂ´t have to deal with in evolution: invisible energymasspacetime/reality/anti-distinction as a part of reasoning. It also has a multi-reason cause for our existence: a time-wise rationale involving the beginning and end of the big bang combined with a 3-pillar existential theory which justifies size and energymass. It is abstract/scientific but canÂ´t be reduced into simpler terms. ItÂ´s the lowest common denominator that everyone can believe in (regardless of religion).
How vaguely has reality defined â€to representâ€?
Infinitely vaguely â€“ anything can represent anything.
Is the representation/representer reality or Allah?
No.
Can anything represent that of which all is part?
No.
Then the size-time-diagram is infinite i.e. nothing represents reality. How many is it? How many is Allah? 1.
Did it sayâ€¦, or did it write a book?
This disproves Allah writing the Quran.
Again: how much of reality can be represented by, say, a painting? The whole of it?
No, the whole of reality cannot be represented. Just like Allah canÂ´t be captured in a picture/word.
We can have hypotheses â€“ how many hypotheses can we have?
If reality is sizes & times, energymass and spacetime then the square-shaped size-time-diagram with energymasspacetime in each coordinate is the universal way to represent all there is to represent.
Does it write books? No, it is not of such authorship-kind nature.
â€œGod said to Muhammed word by wordâ€¦â€ is thus a false or at most metaphorical statement.
â€œYou have to do rituals in order not to go to hell, and in heaven you get 72 virginsâ€ is by the same logic also a false claim.
There are three alternatives as the foundation for this logic â€“ can you think of a 4
th
one?
1: Reality is a synonym for Allah
2: or Allah doesnÂ´t exist
3: or there are 72 virgins (not an alternative because reality is not of the nature, because it is size-time-energymasspacetime, to write books).
In addition to the square size-time diagram with infinity symbols in each of itÂ´s corners, and the evolutionary triangle which designates that life becomes more complex as time goes on (the triangle originates at the central size of the known size-range), there is the following brain diagram:
You have a composite certain truth consisting of two certain truths: you can claim as certain that you think (because if you were being fooled: being fooled is thinking) and that you exist (because being fooled requires the one who is fooled to be there). I think and I exist is one statement but two truths. You can certainly claim to have â€œdistinctionâ€ because youÂ´re dealing with multiple separate distinct entities (such as â€œIâ€ and â€œthoughtâ€). One could put it, while seeing the certain truths â€œI thinkâ€ and â€œI existâ€, that the space between the two notions (thinker and thought) is the hallmark of distinction. The distance separating thinker from thought we can recognize as necessary for â€œdistinctionâ€ to be concluded as a certain truth arising, in a next logical step, from the original primary certain truth.
Are all distinct entities part of a single reality if â€œrealityâ€ is defined as â€œthat of which all is partâ€? In other words: if we draw distinction on the left side of a paper and anti-distinction (distinctionÂ´s opposite: a singular reality â€“ that of which all is part. Zooming out summarizing maximally) on the right side of the paper, then can distinction represent the right side of the paper i.e. anti-distinction? How could some distinct entities depict the very opposite of what representation/distinction is? Any depiction/representation of anti-distinction/reality has at least three entities: thinker, space between thinker and thought, and thought. Separation/distinction is inherent in representation, thus anti-distinction is unrepresentable.
How vaguely has the universe/God defined what a representation is i.e. when a representation occurs? Our brains use neurons to represent, but what if â€“ instead of neurons (regardless of brains) â€“ the universe wills that any random object can be said to, as neurons do, represent reality? The universe has defined â€œrepresentationâ€ infinitely vaguely i.e. disregarding brains, any random object spontaneously is the symbol standing for all of reality â€“ because the universe defines â€œrepresentsâ€ infinitely vaguely. Despite the infinitely vague definition of what represents what, distinction-anti-distinction-opposition (the line separating the left side of the paper from the right side; the countering of distinction with anti-distinction) means that reality is not representable. If reality is anti-distinction then no distinction (representation is inherently distinction) can even, despite an infinitely vague definition of â€œrepresentsâ€, capture reality. In representations we can count at least three things and what weÂ´re trying to capture is one thing with nothing outside it. The fact that representations contain distinction makes capturing reality (all is one) impossible.
We can have infinitely many or infinitely large/substancefull representations/hypotheses â€“ such as an infinite size-time-diagram â€“ and though abstractly accurately pointing to reality, the universeÂ´s rule that nothing represents reality despite infinitely vaguely allowed representations of infinitely much, makes reality unrepresentable. This can only mean one thing: reality â€“ which we know as sizes and times (a size-time-diagram) â€“ is infinite. ThereÂ´s infinitely large and infinitely small with infinitely much past and infinitely much future. This square-shaped size-time-diagram i.e. our everyday experience of size-time has infinities all-over the place.
Energymass in spacetime: one in zero, existence in non-existence, something in nothing â€“ as defined by E=mc
2
where c
2
stands for speed (distance over time i.e. spacetime/zero/non-existence) and E=m referring to energymass (existence, something, all).
Distinction-anti-distinction-opposition: we live in a singular reality but we see multiple objects.
An infinite size-range.
The above three ideas are an existential theory (a theory which explains the existence of a reproducing shape and thus the dawn of evolution and thus our existence). It is modern to utilize three equal ideas to explain oneÂ´s existence â€“ all previous existential theories used either a single idea (monotheism) or a saga (multiple mundane (not very scientific/abstract) ideas) to explain existence.
The predictive quality that makes this existential theory a scientific theory is that it, basing it off an infinite size-range of energymasspacetime and distinction-anti-distinction-opposition, predicts that in an infinite size-range there ought to be a size where reproduction occurs. The existential theory predicts the first DNA, and from there we get to the evolutionary theory.
Another predictive quality is that the theory predicts a
dense
Big Bang. The a priori beginning of the universe logically is emptiness because emptiness doesnÂ´t need any prior logical justification for its existence because it doesnÂ´t exist. In emptiness laws of nature are true, such as the laws pointing toward and handleing energymass (like E=mc
2
), and thus the Big Bang begins infinitely dense because E=mc
2
is equally true simultaneously in the smallest of spaces. Tiny empty spaces having E=mc
2
be true in them simultaneously and directly as there was nothingness predicts a dense Big Bang. A region, contained within event horizons made out of energymasses speeding away at >c (due to dark energy causing accelerating cosmic expansion), is by definition â€œnothingâ€ in which E=mc
2
being true in the tiniest spaces summons a dense big bang out of reach of the closest (v = >c) energymass. Nothingness (out of reach for the closest energymasses because they are speeding away at >c) is summoned in the central point with event horizons as the furthest away border, causing Big Bang (due to laws of nature summoning energymass in the empty center).
The theory of evolution begins with the first reproducing shape. It was a shape that assembled surrounding mass into a similar shape. The existential theory predicts the existence of infinitely many such shapes. What inevitable becomes true when you have reproduction is that some die and some survive (life and death), that the number of offspring that shape make matters and that there is mutations over time. This is true about the shapeÂ´s offspring: some will die and some will survive, the number of offspring they make matters and the offspring can be different from the original shape. These three rules / laws of nature were inactive before the first reproduction occurred. The next main event was that one of these shapes found that if it injected its DNA into other shapesÂ´ reproductive mechanism, it exploited principle number two: that the number of offspring matters. It was the first virus: it hijacked othersÂ´ reproduction. The rule / law of nature that came into play with this event was that â€œpowerâ€ matters: hijacking othersÂ´ reproductive mechanism gives evolutionary benefits. Now weÂ´ve listed the four main rules that govern evolutionary theory: first came the three first, and then came the forth: power. The next main event â€“ to guard against viruses taking over all life / reproductive mechanisms â€“ was that an immune system evolved to protect against virusÂ´ hijack attempts. This required multicellularism. Just like immune systems prompt/require multicellularism, immune systems prompt/require multigenderedism: to win in the arms race against quickly mutating viruses two genders arose to amplify the mutations to the immune system. Mixing genes from two genders creates a more mutated immune system, which can keep ahead in the arms race against quickly-mutating viruses â€œtryingâ€ to mutate to bypass any immune system. The next main event is that one of these multicellular organisms â€“ a fish or worm â€“ of the male gender mutated to be aggressive and defeat other males in battle. He wouldÂ´ve gotten access to many more females than his non-aggressive counter-parts. This too can be called â€œpowerâ€ because the aggressive male hijacks other maleÂ´s access to females by killing the males. This prompts the dinosaurs because larger muscle mass and shaper weaponry is better at killing off competitors. Amongst the dinosaurs there was the mother-offspring bond, placed there by evolution for the evolutionary benefits a mother gets from seeing an offspring survive to adulthood. This bond mutated to involve flock-members because a group working together out-competes any individualists when fighting over anything. The next main event was that someone mapped the flock, in his brain, as a hierarchy (up-down-axis) with the longing to be the top of the hierarchy. This capitalist striving for the top made brains grew larger â€“ larger memory-banks, more accurate predictions and faster planning are all advantages coming from a larger cortex.
It is a major historical event that there finally is an atheistic argument that is shaped like a university course: it is an existential theory plus evolution which not only doesnÂ´t need a personified god to function, but the pillars (infinite sizerange of energymasspacetime and distinction-anti-distinction-opposition) canÂ´t have a personified god added to them as a 4th pillar without the theory sounding ridicilous. Not only does the theory not need a personified god but adding a god destroys the minimalistic rationally complete beauty of the theory. Gods uglify the theory. The dawn of the theory is a major historical event because never before has an entire course (beginning with certain truth, going through the existential theory and ending in evolution) been laid out in the intellectual debate of atheism, as an argument against a personified god.
The anatomy in the brain from hearing certain truth (I think & I am) â€“ the beginning of the course â€“ creates the same neuronal pathways / associations between ideas in every single person who knows certain truth. The logical step to â€œdistinctionâ€ is noting, as a meta-analysis of the primary certain truth, that one has many ideas (I think AND I am) and that one can take logical pathways to the next step in the course (distinction exists). Then juxtaposing anti-distinction with distinction creates the unseeable â€“ â€œdefying reasonâ€ (because reason is, in simple people, only visual) â€“ conclusion that we/distinction cannot see reality/anti-distinction. The distinction-anti-distinction-opposition is hard to grasp because it â€“ like formal logic or math â€“ uses words instead of pictures (the linguistic brainhalf rather than the visual one). We evolved to be like â€œif I see it I believe itâ€ and that was a good heuristic (rule of thumb) because practical sequences of events can be verified as true or untrue by visualizing them. But in this philosophy: no â€“ it has to be linguistic that we deny ourselves the concept â€œall of realityâ€, leading to the conclusion that there is more to reality than anything â€“ however vaguely the universe has defined â€œrepresentâ€ â€“ can represent. This adds infinitely many sizes to our abstract size-range / size-time-diagram; it makes a square (with size on the y-axis and time on the x-axis) with infinity symbols in each corner, which in turn becomes a pillar in our personified-god-denying existential theory.
To come from certain truth, through mere logical steps (meta-analyses and juxtaposition of opposites), to an existential theory which predicts evolution is a major historical event in the history of atheism.
In a historical context the anatomy (neural connections between ideas and sequences of logic) created by this course is like a paradigm-shift into a new era of earth society â€“ an era similar to that existent on infinitely many other planets who have come further than our midway-mark in a regular water-bearing planetÂ´s history.
Evolution, by beginning with â€œa mass that can assemble surrounding mass into a similar shapeâ€ steps forth from the existential theoryÂ´s infinite size-range of energymasspacetime. Assuming DNA is the replication-molecule, we can step â€“ skipping over how cell walls evolved etc â€“ to the fact that viruses mutate to hijack othersÂ´ reproductive system. This â€“ in this universal inter-planetary extraterrestrial culture â€“ is formulated, in books of logic, as first three rules arising (life/death, number of offspring matters and â€œthere is mutation in each generation-shiftâ€) and then a forth rule arising (power, with viruses). This story â€“ which in our course begins from a first reproducing shape and ends with finessing the anatomy of power in men â€“ is visualizable like the caveman story-telling narratives we evolved to hear/see. We can proof-check its validity/possibility by following the narrative visually. The visual nature of evolution is in stark contrast to the purely linguistic/abstract nature of the existential theory.
Speaking of â€œabstractâ€ descriptions i.e. descriptions that make it very clear to us that our understanding of the universe is a mere map (a reference) and not reality itself (mind you of PlatoÂ´s or KantÂ´s cave-metaphor and â€œthe thing is not the thing itselfâ€ -philosophies)â€¦ The size-range of energymasspacetime, at the size of quantum physics has us describe photons etc using both the wave-description which focuses on lengths of space (this is the â€œspacetime descriptionâ€) AND â€“ in wave-particle duality â€“ the energymass description that the energy of a photon is its color. Color (as perceived through the eyes), wave/spacetime-description and particle-energy/energymass-description all are valid descriptors of quantum particles. This ability of ours to describe any mass/phenomenon using both energymass- and spacetime-descriptions runs throughout the entire size-range. You can imagine two lines â€“ one representing energymass and the other representing spacetime â€“ running vertically through the pictures on the size-axis. Adding complexity to this, there is likewise two lines â€“ gravity and electromagnetism â€“ both running through the size-axis, gravity having itÂ´s duality of energymass and spacetime descriptions and electromagnetism too having both, in every level of the size-range, energymass and spacetime descriptions. Gravity is both Newtonian â€œmasses pulling toward massesâ€ (energymassÂ´ focus on mass) and Einsteinian â€œcurvature of spacetimeâ€ (spacetimeÂ´s focus on space) â€“ both descriptors are accurate.
We are half-way in a planetÂ´s history â€“ 4.5 billion years have passed and 5 billion remain. The theory you now know is, in other words, in cosmic majority â€“ more planets have it than not (if it takes approximately half of a planetÂ´s history to invent it and if it remains true for the rest of the planetÂ´s history). Most other planets i.e. the majority of extraterrestrials are ideological adherents of the theory. Spread this theory to get approval of the majority even though it lives light-years away. Currently 99.9% of the worldÂ´s population lives in the era of religions â€“ spread this theory to end religious wars and terrorism like 9/11. The world-view (the view/diagrams that explain the world) is the same in the cosmic majority.
IÂ´ve worked 10 years to invent this theory and as alone bearing it itÂ´s my responsibility that it spreads. The future civilization in which everyone has the same world-view thus is dependent on me. I feel a unique ability to influence earthÂ´s future.

Swedish important semi-book 2017
Texten bÃ¶rjar med sÃ¤ker sanning, sedan gÃ¥r den till att fÃ¶rklara varfÃ¶r nÃ¥gonting existerar istÃ¤llet fÃ¶r ingenting (den existentiella teorin â€“ varfÃ¶r vi existerar), sedan gÃ¥r den till evolutionÃ¤r teori vilket fÃ¶rutsÃ¤gs av den existentiella teorin. Den evolutionÃ¤ra teorin fÃ¶rklarar vardagsfenomen.
Du vet med sÃ¤kerhet att du tÃ¤nker och att du existerar eftersom om du skulle bliva lurad av en allsmÃ¤ktig demon som fÃ¶rsÃ¶ker lura dig i allt du kan bli lurad i, sÃ¥ Ã¤r lurendrejeriet i sig en tanke-process och dÃ¤rfÃ¶r vet du att tankar existerar (du tÃ¤nker). FÃ¶r att du ska bli lurad sÃ¥ mÃ¥ste du existera och dÃ¤rfÃ¶r vet du â€jag existerarâ€. Att bli lurad Ã¤r en tankeprocess och tÃ¤nkaren Ã¤r nÃ¶dvÃ¤ndig fÃ¶r att det ska finnas nÃ¥gon som blir lurad. SÃ¥ du vet: oavsett vad sÃ¥ tÃ¤nker du och existerar du. Ã…vanstÃ¥ende Ã¤r tvÃ¥ saker, eller hur? De Ã¤r bÃ¥da del av samma hjÃ¤rna och samma tankeprocess kan bli ens analytiska verktygssats/tÃ¤nkare, men vi erkÃ¤nner Ã¤ndÃ¥ att det finns distinkta entiteter â€“ att det finns distinktion. Detta kan ocksÃ¥ kallas separation. Vad Ã¤r distinktions motsats, anti-distinktion? Det Ã¤r en verklighet; det som allt Ã¤r del av; den Ã¤r en och dess definition i ordboken Ã¤r att allt Ã¤r del av den. Om vi skriver distinktion (tÃ¤nkare och tanke) pÃ¥ vÃ¤nster sida av ett papper och anti-distinktion (verkligheten; det som allt Ã¤r del av; en) pÃ¥ hÃ¶ger sida av pappret â€“ kan den vÃ¤nstra sidan se den hÃ¶gra sidan? Nej, fÃ¶r att oppositionen mellan distinktion och anti-distinktion. Det finns alltid en observerare (tÃ¤nkaren) och dÃ¤rmed distinktion i varje observation och dÃ¤rmed kan anti-distinktion ej representeras/ses.
HjÃ¤rnan evolverade fÃ¶r att hantera naturliga fenomen â€“ det fanns aldrig ett scenario i historien dÃ¥ nÃ¥gonting osynligt behÃ¶vde hanteras och betÃ¤nkas. DÃ¤rfÃ¶r antar vi att tanke-processen blev fel nÃ¤r vi sÃ¤ger att distinktion/vi inte kan se anti-distinktion/verkligheten. Men tankeprocessen gick inte fel: allt det betyder Ã¤r att det finns mer till verkligheten Ã¤n kan representeras. Oavsett hur vagt â€representerasâ€ Ã¤r definierat, lÃ¥t oss sÃ¤ga att en kaffekopp â€“ oavsett om hjÃ¤rnor Ã¤r involverade eller inte â€“ antas fÃ¶rsÃ¶ka representera det som allt Ã¤r del av, dÃ¥ gÃ¶r anti-distinktions-distinktions-oppositionen (motsÃ¤ttningen mellan distinktion och dess motsats) att representationen Ã¤r inkorrekt. Vi kan frÃ¥ga om en anti-distinkt â€sakâ€ har en maximumstorlek och dÃ¤rmed distinktion? Nej. PÃ¥ samma not Ã¤r ett annat bevis fÃ¶r att storleksskalan Ã¤r oÃ¤ndlig Ã¤r att vi ser nÃ¥gonting (vÃ¥r vardagsvÃ¤rld) samt kan gÃ¶ra hypoteser ad infinitum, och Ã¤ndÃ¥ representerar ingenting ALL verklighet. Verkligheten dvs storlek-tid Ã¤r dÃ¤rfÃ¶r oÃ¤ndligt.
En oÃ¤ndlig storleksskala Ã¤r en av pelarna i den existentiella teorin. En annan pelare Ã¤r att energimassa och rumtid Ã¤r motsatser (opposition) men sammanflÃ¤tade sÃ¥som i E=mc
2
(dÃ¤r c
2
hÃ¤nvisar till en hastighet dvs rum Ã¶ver tid: rumtid). Multiplikationen sammanfÃ¶r energimassa tillsammans med rumtid; ingenting tillsammans med nÃ¥gonting/allting; existens tillsammans med icke-existens. VarfÃ¶r finns det existens i form av min kropp? Utan att gÃ¥ in i det historiska svaret sÃ¥ kan man fÃ¶rklara det genom att sÃ¤ga att kroppen Ã¤r nÃ¥gonting i (sammanflÃ¤tat med) ingenting, av en storlek i en oÃ¤ndlig storleks-skala (dÃ¤r relationen mellan vilka tvÃ¥ storlekar som helst (eller objekt av tvÃ¥ storlekar) Ã¤r att de Ã¤r fÃ¶rklaringen till varandra dvs rÃ¤ttfÃ¤rdigar varandra. Sedan finns det ocksÃ¥, som tredje pelare, distinktions-anti-distinktions-opposition dvs vi lever i en singular (ej plural) verklighet men ser distinkta/separata entiteter sÃ¥som tÃ¤nkare och tanke.
PÃ¥ tal om rumtid, rumtid Ã¤r den logiska startpunkten fÃ¶r den tidsbaserade existentiella teorin. Ingenting (tom rumtid) behÃ¶ver inget inledande/tidigare rÃ¤ttfÃ¤rdigande eller anledning att existera, fÃ¶r att det existerar inte. I den, hursomhelst, Ã¤r naturlagarna sanna dvs den Ã¤r inte irrationell / anti-logisk, och bland naturlagarna finns de som, inklusive E=mc
2
, som nÃ¤mner energimassa. Skulle energimassa kunna â€nÃ¤mnasâ€ utan att det skulle existera? Om â€jaâ€ sÃ¥ skulle det vara absurt / anti-logiskt. VarfÃ¶r skulle verkligheten nÃ¤mna saker som aldrig existerar? Eftersom naturlagarna Ã¤r strikta och tack vare vÃ¥r regel â€det som nÃ¤mns mÃ¥ste existera eller uppstÃ¥â€ sÃ¥ fÃ¥r vi, varÃ¤n (i de minsta storlekarna) dÃ¤r E=mc
2
nÃ¤mns, sÃ¥ finns existens och dÃ¤rfÃ¶r en tÃ¤t big bang. Faktumet att galaxer rusar ivÃ¤g accelererandes frÃ¥n varandra leder till ingenting (tom rymd) i framtiden, och med mellanhanden â€naturlagarâ€ sÃ¥ uppstÃ¥r energimassa igen sÃ¥ tÃ¤t som den kan vara. Ingen tids-delay mellan ingenting â€“ naturlagar â€“ energimassa men sÃ¥ snart en begrÃ¤nsad (av event-horizons som bestÃ¤ms av ljuset Ã¤ndliga hastighet) region blir ingenting/tomrum, sÃ¥ uppstÃ¥r en big bang som sedan genom kosmisk expansion blir ingenting igen, som sedan blir tomrum och en ny big bang igen. Detta Ã¤r den tidsmÃ¤ssiga beskrivningen om varfÃ¶r energimassa (som existerar sammanflÃ¤tad med rumtid sÃ¥som i E=mc
2
) bÃ¶rjar tÃ¤t och blir ingenting, och sedan repetitation.
Det Ã¥vanstÃ¥ende Ã¤r en rivalteori till â€Gud skapade jorden pÃ¥ 6 dagar och vilade pÃ¥ den sjundeâ€. Den Ã¤r inte intuitiv eftersom den har att gÃ¶ra med saker som vi inte hade att gÃ¶ra med under evolutionen: osynliga energimassarumtid/verkligheten/anti-distinktion som del av vÃ¥rt resonemang. Den har ocksÃ¥ en multi-anledning orsak fÃ¶r vÃ¥r existens: en tidsvis rationale involverandes bÃ¶rjan och slutet pÃ¥ big bang, kombinerad med en 3-pelares existentiell teori som rÃ¤ttfÃ¤rdigar storlek och energimassa. Den Ã¤r abstrakt/vetenskaplig men kan inte reduceras till simplare termer. Det Ã¤r den minsta gemensamma nÃ¤mnaren som alla kan tro pÃ¥ (oavsett religion).
Hur vagt har verkligheten definerat â€att representeraâ€?
OÃ¤ndligt vagt â€“ vad som helst kan representera vad som helst.
Ã„r representationen/representÃ¶ren verkligheten eller Allah?
Nej.
Kan nÃ¥gonting representera det som allt Ã¤r del av?
Nej.
DÃ¥ Ã¤r storleks-tids-diagrammet oÃ¤ndligt dvs inget representerar verkligheten. Hur mÃ¥nga Ã¤r den? Hur mÃ¥nga Ã¤r Allah? 1.
Sa denâ€¦, eller skrev den en bok?
Detta motbevisar att Allah skrev en bok.
Igen: hur mycket av verkligheten kan representeras av, sÃ¤g, en mÃ¥lning? All den?
Nej, hela verkligheten kan ej representeras. Precis som Allah inte kan fÃ¥ngas i ett ord/en bild.
Vi kan ha hypoteser â€“ hur mÃ¥nga hypoteser kan vi ha?
Om verkligheten Ã¤r storlekar och tider, energimassa och rumtid sÃ¥ Ã¤r det rektangulÃ¤ra storleks-tids-diagrammet med energimassarumtid i varje koordinat det universella sÃ¤ttet att representera allt som finns att representera.
Skriver den bÃ¶cker? Nej, den Ã¤r inte av fÃ¶rfattarnatur.
â€Gud sa till Muhammed ord fÃ¶r ordâ€¦â€ Ã¤r alltsÃ¥ ett falskt eller som mest ett metaforiskt pÃ¥stÃ¥ende.
â€Du mÃ¥ste gÃ¶ra ritualer fÃ¶r att inte hamna i helvetet, och i himmelen fÃ¥r du 72 oskulderâ€ Ã¤r med samma logik ocksÃ¥ ett falskt pÃ¥stÃ¥ende.
Det finns tre alternativ som fundament fÃ¶r denna logik â€“ kan du tÃ¤nka ut ett fjÃ¤rde?
1: Verkligheten Ã¤r ett synonym fÃ¶r Allah,
2: eller sÃ¥ finns inte Allah
3: eller sÃ¥ finns 72 oskulder (ej ett alternativ eftersom verkligheten inte Ã¤r av den naturen, dÃ¥ den Ã¤r storleks-tids-energimassarumtid, att den skriver bÃ¶cker).
Som tillÃ¤gg till det rektangulÃ¤ra storleks-tids-diagrammet med oÃ¤ndlighetssymboler i varje hÃ¶rn, och den evolutionÃ¤ra triangeln som representerar att livet blev mer komplext ju mer tiden gick (triangelns spets har sitt ursprung i mittersta storleken i den kÃ¤nda storleksskalan), finns fÃ¶ljande hjÃ¤rn-diagram:
Den existentiella teorin med dess tre pelare, dvs en oÃ¤ndlig storleksskala, energimassarumtid och distinktions-anti-distinktions-opposition, fÃ¶rutsÃ¤ger att det borde finnas en liten bit DNA som kopierar sig.
Evolutionsteorin bÃ¶rjar med den fÃ¶rsta reproducerande formen. Det var en form som samlande kringliggande massa till en liknande form. Den existentiella teorin fÃ¶rutsÃ¤ger existensen av oÃ¤ndligt mÃ¥nga sÃ¥dana former. Det som oundvikligen blir sant nÃ¤r man har reproduktion Ã¤r att vissa dÃ¶r medan andra Ã¶verlever (liv och dÃ¶d), att antalet avkomma/kopior formen gÃ¶r har betydelse och att det finns mutationer Ã¶ver tid. FÃ¶ljande Ã¤r sant om formens avkomma: vissa dÃ¶r medan andra Ã¶verlever, antalet avkomma har betydelse och avkomman Ã¤r annorlunda frÃ¥n originalformen. Dessa tre regler / naturlagar var inaktiva innan den fÃ¶rsta reproduktionen skedde. NÃ¤sta stora steg var nÃ¤r ett av dessa former mÃ¶jliggjorde fÃ¶r sig sjÃ¤lv att injicera sitt DNA in i andra formers reproduktiva mekanism, vilket utnyttjade princip nr 2: att antalet avkomma har betydelse. Det var det fÃ¶rsta viruset: den hijackade andras reproduktion. Regeln / naturlagen som kom i spel i.om. denna hÃ¤ndelse var att â€maktâ€ har betydelse: att hijacka andras reproduktiva mekanism ger evolutionÃ¤ra fÃ¶rdelar. Nu har vi lagt fram de fyra huvudregelerna som Ã¤r evolutionsteori: fÃ¶rst kom de tre fÃ¶rsta reglerna, sedan kom den fjÃ¤rde: makt. NÃ¤sta stora hÃ¤ndelse â€“ fÃ¶r att skydda mot att virus hijackar alla reproduktiva system â€“ var att ett immunsystem evolverade fÃ¶r att skydda mot virus hijacks-fÃ¶rsÃ¶k. Detta behÃ¶vde multicellulÃ¤rism. Precis som immunsystem krÃ¤ver multicellularism, sÃ¥ behÃ¶ver immunsystem multikÃ¶nadhet: fÃ¶r att vinna i kampen dÃ¤r virus muterar fÃ¶r att kringgÃ¥ immunsystem sÃ¥ behÃ¶ver immunsystemet ocksÃ¥ maximalt med mutation. Att mixa gener frÃ¥n tvÃ¥ kÃ¶n skapar ett mer muterat immunsystem, vilket hÃ¥ller ut i kampen mot virus dÃ¤r virus â€fÃ¶rsÃ¶kerâ€ mutera sig runt immunsystemet. Den nÃ¤sta stora hÃ¤ndelsen var att en av dessa multicellulÃ¤ra organismer â€“ en fisk eller mask â€“ av det manliga kÃ¶net muterade till att vara agressiv och fÃ¶rinta andra manliga varelser. Han skulle ha fÃ¥tt hÃ¶gre tillgÃ¥ng till kvinnliga organismer jÃ¤mfÃ¶rt med hans icke-agressiva likar. Detta kan ocksÃ¥ kallas â€maktâ€ eftersom agressiva hanar hijackar andra hanars tillgÃ¥ng till kvinnor genom att dÃ¶da hanarna. Detta orsakar dinosaurierna eftersom stÃ¶rre muskelmassa och skarpare vapen Ã¤r bÃ¤ttre pÃ¥ att dÃ¶da rivalerna. Bland dinosaurierna fanns moder-avkomma-bandet, ditplacerad av evolutionen eftersom det var en fÃ¶rdel fÃ¶r mÃ¶drar att se sina barn Ã¶verleva till vuxenskap. Detta band muterade till att involvera flock-medlemmar eftersom en grupp sammarbetandes bÃ¤ttre kan vinna Ã¶ver individualister i brÃ¥k om vad som helst. NÃ¤sta stora steg var att nÃ¥gon kartlade flocken, i sin hjÃ¤rna, som en hierarki (upp-ned-axeln) med en lÃ¤ngtan efter att stÃ¥ hÃ¶gst upp i hierarkin. Denna kapitalistiska tÃ¤vlan mot toppen gjorde att hjÃ¤rnan vÃ¤xte sig stÃ¶rre â€“ stÃ¶rre minnesbank, mer detaljrika fÃ¶rutsÃ¤gelser och snabbare planering Ã¤r alla fÃ¶rdelar som kommer frÃ¥n att ha ett stÃ¶rre kortex.
Du har en komposit-sÃ¤ker sanning bestÃ¥endes av tvÃ¥ sÃ¤kra sanningar: du kan med sÃ¤kerhet sÃ¤ga att du tÃ¤nker (fÃ¶r att om du skulle bli lurad: att bli lurad Ã¤r en tankeprocess) och att du existerar (eftersom att bli lurad krÃ¤ver den som blir lurad). Jag tÃ¤nker och jag finns Ã¤r ett pÃ¥stÃ¥ende men tvÃ¥ sanningar. Du kan med sÃ¤kerhet pÃ¥stÃ¥ dig ha â€distinktionâ€ eftersom du har att gÃ¶ra med multipla separata entiteter (sÃ¥som â€jagâ€ och â€tankarâ€). Man kan sÃ¤ga, nÃ¤r man ser den sÃ¤kra sanningens â€jag tÃ¤nkerâ€ och â€jag existerarâ€, att avstÃ¥endet/mellanrummet mellan de tvÃ¥ idÃ©erna (tÃ¤nkare och tanke) Ã¤r distinktion. AvstÃ¥endet/mellanrummet som separarar tÃ¤nkare frÃ¥n tanke Ã¤r nÃ¶dvÃ¤ndigt fÃ¶r â€disktinktionâ€ att hÃ¤rledas som sÃ¤ker sanning fÃ¶ljandes ur nÃ¤sta logiska steg, med ursprunget av den originella primÃ¤ra sÃ¤kra sanningen.
Ã„r alla distinkta entiteter del av en singulÃ¤r verklighet om â€verklighetenâ€ Ã¤r definierad som â€det som allt Ã¤r del avâ€? Med andra ord: om vi ritar distinktion pÃ¥ vÃ¤nster sida av ett papper och anti-distinktion (distinktionÂ´s motsats: en ensam verklighet â€“ det som allt Ã¤r del av. Zoomandes ut maximalt) pÃ¥ hÃ¶ger sida av pappret, kan dÃ¥ distinktion representera hÃ¶ger sida av pappret dvs anti-distinktion? Hur skulle nÃ¥gon distinkt entitet kunna vara/representera motsatsen till vad representation/distinktion Ã¤r? Vilken representation som helst av anti-distinktion/verkligheten mÃ¥ste ha minst tre entiteter: tÃ¤nkare, mellanrummet mellan tÃ¤nkare och tanke, och tanke.
Separation/distinktion Ã¤r antaget i representation, vilket innebÃ¤r att anti-distinktion Ã¤r orepreserbart.
Hur vagt har universum/Gud definerat vad en representation Ã¤r dvs nÃ¤r en representation sker? VÃ¥ra hjÃ¤rnor anvÃ¤nder neuroner fÃ¶r att representera, men vad sÃ¤gs om â€“ istÃ¤llet fÃ¶r neuroner (oavsett om hjÃ¤rnor Ã¤r inblandade eller inte) â€“ universum lÃ¥ter vilket slumpmÃ¤ssigt valt objekt som helst lÃ¥ta sig sÃ¤gas, sÃ¥som neuroner sÃ¤gs, representera verkligheten? Universum har definierat â€representationâ€ oÃ¤ndligt vagt dvs uteslutandes hjÃ¤rnor sÃ¥ kan vilket slumpmÃ¤ssigt objekt som helst spotant bli/vara symbolen fÃ¶r all verklighet â€“ fÃ¶r att universum har definierat â€representeraâ€ oÃ¤ndligt vagt. Trots den oÃ¤ndligt vaga definitionen av vad som representerar vad, sÃ¥ gÃ¶r distinktions-anti-distinktions-oppositionen (linjen som separerar vÃ¤nster sida av pappret frÃ¥n hÃ¶ger sida; motsÃ¤ttningen mellan distinktion och anti-distinktion) att verkligheten Ã¤r orepresenterbar. Om verkligheten Ã¤r anti-distinktion dÃ¥ finns ingen distinktion (representation Ã¤r oundvikligen distinktion), trots universums oÃ¤ndligt vaga definition av â€representeraâ€, fÃ¥nga verkligheten. I representationer kan vi rÃ¤kna minst tre saker och det vi fÃ¶rsÃ¶ker representera Ã¤r en sak utan nÃ¥gonting utanfÃ¶r den. Faktumet att representationer innehÃ¥ller distinktion gÃ¶r att att fÃ¥nga verkligheten (allt som ett) omÃ¶jligt.
Vi kan ha oÃ¤ndligt mÃ¥nga eller oÃ¤ndligt innehÃ¥llsfulla/stora representationer/hypoteser â€“ sÃ¥som ett oÃ¤ndligt storleks-tids-diagram â€“ och genom att abstrakt peka till verkligheten, sÃ¥ gÃ¶r universums regel att ingenting representerar verkligheten trots universums oÃ¤ndligt vaga definition av â€representeraâ€ av oÃ¤ndligt mycket, gÃ¶r verkligheten orepresenterbar. Detta kan bara betyda en sak: verkligheten â€“ som vi kÃ¤nner som storlekar och tider (ett storleks-tids-diagram) â€“ Ã¤r oÃ¤ndligt. Det finns oÃ¤ndligt stort och oÃ¤ndligt litet med oÃ¤ndligt mycket dÃ¥tid och oÃ¤ndligt mycket framtid. Detta rektangulÃ¤ra storleks-tids-diagram dvs vÃ¥r vardagsvÃ¤rld av storlek-tid har oÃ¤ndligheter Ã¶verallt.
Energimassa i rumtid: ett i noll, existens i icke-existens, nÃ¥gonting i ingenting â€“ sÃ¥som definierats av E=mc
2
dÃ¤r c
2
stÃ¥r fÃ¶r ljusets hastighet (rum Ã¶ver tid dvs rumtid/noll/icke-existens) och E=m refererar till energimassa (existens, nÃ¥gonting, allt).
Distinktions-anti-distinktions-opposition: vi lever i en singulÃ¤r verklighet men vi ser multipla objekt.
En oÃ¤ndlig storleksskala.
De Ã¥vanstÃ¥ende tre idÃ©erna Ã¤r en existentiell teori (en teori som fÃ¶rklarar existensen av en reproduktiv form dvs evolutions bÃ¶rjan dvs vÃ¥r existens). Det Ã¤r modernt att anvÃ¤nda sig av tre likvÃ¤rdiga idÃ©er fÃ¶r att fÃ¶rklara ens existens â€“ alla tidigare existentiella teorier har antingen anvÃ¤nt en enda idÃ© (monoteism) eller en saga/myt (mÃ¥nga vardagliga (ej vetenskapliga/abstrakta) idÃ©er) fÃ¶r att fÃ¶rklara existens.
Den fÃ¶rutsÃ¤gande kvalitÃ©n som gÃ¶r denna existentiella teori till en vetenskaplig teori Ã¤r att den, baserat pÃ¥ en oÃ¤ndlig storleksskala av energimassarumtid och distinktions-anti-distinktions-opposition, fÃ¶rutsÃ¤ger att det i en oÃ¤ndlig storleksskala borde finnas en storlek dÃ¤r reproduktion (DNA) sker. Den existentiella teorin fÃ¶rutsÃ¤ger det fÃ¶rsta DNA:t, och frÃ¥n det fÃ¥r vi evolutionÃ¤r teori.
En annan fÃ¶rutsÃ¤gande kvalitÃ© Ã¤r att teorin fÃ¶rutsÃ¤ger att big bang borde varit
tÃ¤t
. A-priori begynnelsen av universum Ã¤r logiskt sett tomhet eftersom tomhet inte behÃ¶ver nÃ¥gon tidigare/fÃ¶religgande logiskt rÃ¤ttfÃ¤rdigande eftersom det ej existerar. I tom rumtid Ã¤r naturlagarna sanna, sÃ¥som naturlagarna som hanterar energimassa (sÃ¥som E=mc
2
), och dÃ¤rfÃ¶r bÃ¶rjar big bang oÃ¤ndligt tÃ¤t â€“ fÃ¶r att E=mc
2
Ã¤r lika sann samtidigt i de minsta storlekarna. De minsta tomma rymderna hade E=mc
2
som sann inom sig direkt nÃ¤r det fanns ingenting, vilket fÃ¶rutsÃ¤ger en tÃ¤t big bang. En region, inom event horizons gjorda av energimassa rusandes ivÃ¤g i >c (pga mÃ¶rk energi accelererandes kosmisk expansion) Ã¤r per definition â€ingentingâ€ i vilket E=mc
2
Ã¤r sann i de minsta utrymmena, vilket Ã¥stadkommer en big bang utom rÃ¤ckhÃ¥ll fÃ¶r de nÃ¤rmaste ( v = >c) energimassa. Ingenting (utom rÃ¤ckhÃ¥ll fÃ¶r nÃ¤rmaste energimassa fÃ¶r att den Ã¤r pÃ¥ vÃ¤g bortÃ¥t i >c) orsakas i centrumpunkten som har event horizons som grÃ¤ns lÃ¤ngst bort, vilket leder till en big bang (eftersom naturlagarna uppbringar energimassa i det tomma centrumet).
Det Ã¤r en stor historisk hÃ¤ndelse att det Ã¤ntligen finns ett ateistiskt argument i form av en universitetskurs: det Ã¤r en existentiell teori plus evolution som inte behÃ¶ver en personifierad gud fÃ¶r att fungera, utan dess pelare (oÃ¤ndlig storleksskala av energimassarumtid och distinktions-anti-distinktions-opposition) kan inte ha en personifierad gud tillagd till dem som en fjÃ¤rde pelare utan att teorin lÃ¥ter lÃ¶jlig. Det Ã¤r inte bara sÃ¥ att teorin inte behÃ¶ver en personifierad gud, utan att lÃ¤gga till en gud fÃ¶rstÃ¶r teorins minimalistiska rationellt kompletta skÃ¶nhet. Gudar fÃ¶rfular teorin. Teorins upptÃ¤ckt Ã¤r en stor historisk hÃ¤ndelse eftersom aldrig fÃ¶rr har en hel kurs (bÃ¶rjandes med sÃ¤ker sanning, gÃ¥endes genom den existentiella teorin och slutandes i evolution) lagts fram i ateismens intellektuella debatt, som ett argument mot en personifierad gud.
Anatomin i hjÃ¤rnan frÃ¥n att hÃ¶ra sÃ¤ker sanning (jag tÃ¤nker & jag finns) â€“ bÃ¶rjan av denna kurs â€“ skapar samma neuronala pathways / associationer mellan idÃ©er i varje person som hÃ¶r vet sÃ¤ker sanning. Det logiska steget till â€distinktionâ€ Ã¤r att notera, som meta-analys av den primÃ¤ra sÃ¤kra sanningen â€“ att man har mÃ¥nga idÃ©er (jag tÃ¤nker OCH jag finns) och att man kan ta den logiska vÃ¤gen till nÃ¤sta steg i kursen (distinktion finns). Att sedan motsÃ¤tta anti-distinktion med distinktion skapar den ofÃ¶rnimmbara â€“ â€mot resonâ€ (eftersom logik Ã¤r, i simpla mÃ¤nniskor, enbart visuell) â€“ slutsatsen att vi/distinktion inte kan se verkligheten/anti-distinktion. Distinktions-anti-distinktions-oppositionen Ã¤r svÃ¥rbegriplig fÃ¶r att den â€“ sÃ¥som formell logik eller matematik â€“ enbart anvÃ¤nder ord istÃ¤llet fÃ¶r bilder (den lingvistiska hjÃ¤rnhalvan istÃ¤llet fÃ¶r den visuella). Vi evolverade till att sÃ¤ga â€om jag kan se det sÃ¥ tror jag pÃ¥ detâ€ och det Ã¤r en god tumregel eftersom praktiska sekvenser hÃ¤ndelser kan verifieras som sanna eller osanna genom att visualisera dem. Men i denna filosofi: nej â€“ det mÃ¥ste vara lingvistiskt att vi fÃ¶rnekar oss sjÃ¤lva konceptet â€all verklighetâ€, vilket leder till slutsatsen att det finns mer till verkligheten Ã¤n nÃ¥gonting â€“ oavsett hur vagt universum definerat â€att representeraâ€ â€“ representerar. Detta tillÃ¤gger oÃ¤ndligt mÃ¥nga storlekar till vÃ¥r abstrakta stoorleksskala / storleks-tids-diagrammet; det gÃ¶r en rektangel (med storlek pÃ¥ y-axeln och tid pÃ¥ x-axeln) med oÃ¤ndlighetstecken i varje hÃ¶rn, som i sin tur blir en pelare i vÃ¥r personlig-gud-fÃ¶rnekande existentiella teori.
Att komma frÃ¥n sÃ¤ker sanningen genom enbart logiska steg (meta-analyser och motsÃ¤ttningsskapande av motsatser) till en existentiell teori som fÃ¶rutsÃ¤er evolutionen Ã¤r en stor historisk hÃ¤ndelse i ateismens historia.
I ett historiskt sammanhang Ã¤r anatomin (neurala anslutningar mellan idÃ©er och sekvenser logik) som skapas av denna kurs som ett paradigm-shifte in i en ny era av civilisation â€“ en era liknande den som finns pÃ¥ oÃ¤ndligt mÃ¥nga planeter vars vetenskap kommit lÃ¤ngre Ã¤n vÃ¥ra 4.5 miljarder Ã¥rs mittenpunkt i en vanlig vattenbÃ¤rande planets historia.
Evolution, genom att bÃ¶rja frÃ¥n â€en massa som samlar kringliggande massa till en liknande formâ€ kliver fram frÃ¥n den existentiella teorins oÃ¤ndliga storleksskala av energimassarumtid. Om vi antar att DNA Ã¤r replikationsmolekylen sÃ¥ kan vi ta steget till â€“ klivandes Ã¶ver hur cellvÃ¤ggar evolverade osv â€“ till att virus hijackar andras reproduktiva system. Detta â€“ i den universella inter-planetÃ¤ra rymdvarelsekulturen â€“ formuleras som, i bÃ¶cker av logik, som att de tre fÃ¶rsta reglerna uppkommer (liv/dÃ¶d, antalet avkomma har betydelse och â€det sker mutationer i varje generationsskifteâ€) och sedan att en fjÃ¤rde regel uppkommer (makt, med virus). Denna historia â€“ som i vÃ¥r kurs bÃ¶rjar frÃ¥n den fÃ¶rsta reproduktiva formen och slutar i att finslipa anatomin bakom makt i mÃ¤n â€“ Ã¤r visualiseringsbar som en grottmanna-historias narrativ likt dem vi evolverade till att se/hÃ¶ra. Vi kan proof-checka/validera historian genom att se den visuellt. Evolutions visuella natur Ã¤r i stark kontrast till den rent linguistiska/abstraka natur som den existentiella teorin har.
PÃ¥ tal om â€abstraktaâ€ beskrivningar dvs beskrivningar som gÃ¶r det vÃ¤ldigt klart fÃ¶r oss att vÃ¥r fÃ¶rstÃ¥else av universum bara Ã¤r en karta (en referens) och inte verkligheten i sig (tÃ¤nk pÃ¥ PlatoÂ´s och KantÂ´s grottmetafor och â€saken Ã¤r inte saken sjÃ¤lvâ€-filosofierâ€)â€¦ Storleksskalan av energimassarumtid, i storleken av kvantfysik har oss beskrivandes fotoner etc anvÃ¤ndandes bÃ¥de vÃ¥g-beskrivningar med fokus pÃ¥ lÃ¤ngder i rymd (dessa Ã¤r â€rumtids-beskrivningarâ€) OCH â€“ i vÃ¥r-partikel-dualitet â€“ energimassabeskrivningen dvs att energin i en foton Ã¤r dess fÃ¤rg. FÃ¤rg (sÃ¥som den uppfattas genom Ã¶gonen), vÃ¥g/rumtids-beskrivningen och partikel-energi/energimassa-beskrivningen Ã¤r alla legitimea beskrivningar av kvantfysiken. VÃ¥r fÃ¶rmÃ¥ga att beskriva vilken massa/vilket fenomen som helst med bÃ¥de energimassa- och rumtids-beskrivningar lÃ¶per genom hela storleksskalan. Du kan fÃ¶restÃ¤lla dig tvÃ¥ linjer â€“ en fÃ¶r energimassa och en fÃ¶r rumtid â€“ gÃ¥endes vertikalt genom alla bilder pÃ¥ storleks-axeln. TillÃ¤ggandes komplexitet pÃ¥ detta finns det tvÃ¥ linjer till â€“ tyngdlagen och elektromagnetism â€“ bÃ¥da gÃ¥endes lÃ¤ngs storleks-axeln, tyngdlagen har dess dualitet av energimassa- och rumtids-beskrivningar och elektromagnetism likasÃ¥ har desamma, dvs energimassa och rumtidsbeskrivningar. Tyngdlagen Ã¤r bÃ¥de Newtonisk â€massor dras till massorâ€ (energimassas fokus pÃ¥ massa) och Einsteinsk â€rumtids krÃ¶kningâ€ (rumtids fokus pÃ¥ rum) â€“ bÃ¥da beskrivningar Ã¤r korrekta.
Vi Ã¤r halvvÃ¤gs igenom en planets historia â€“ 4.5 miljarder Ã¥r har gÃ¥tt och 5 miljarder Ã¥terstÃ¥r. Teorin som du nu vet Ã¤r m.a.o. i kosmisk majoritet â€“ fler planeter har den Ã¤n har den inte (om det tar ungefÃ¤r hÃ¤lften av planetens historia att uppfinna den och om den kvarstÃ¥r under andra hÃ¤lften av planetens historia). De flesta andra planeter dvs majoriteten av rymdvarelser Ã¤r m.a.o. ideologiska anhÃ¤ngare av teorin. Sprid denna teori fÃ¶r att fÃ¥ bekrÃ¤ftelse av majoriteten trots att den bor ljusÃ¥r bort. Just nu lever 99.9% av jordens befolkning i eran av religioner â€“ sprid denna teori fÃ¶r att fÃ¥ slut pÃ¥ religiÃ¶sa krig samt terrorism sÃ¥som 9/11. VÃ¤rldsbilden (bilden/diagrammet som fÃ¶rklarar vÃ¤rlden) Ã¤r densamma i den kosmiska majoriteten.
Jag har jobbat i 10 Ã¥r fÃ¶r att Ã¥stadkomma teorin och som ensam om att kÃ¤nna till den Ã¤r det mitt ansvar att den sprids. Den framtida civilizationen i vilken alla har samma vÃ¤rldsbild hÃ¤nger dÃ¤rfÃ¶r pÃ¥ mig. Jag kÃ¤nner en unik mÃ¶jlighet att pÃ¥verka jordens framtid.

Can we
timetravel? We can proceed from era to era, just like dinosaurs preceded man and not vice versa â€“ its a universal sequence on any planet.
Heaven/karma instinctual but collides with main picture.
Water, primordial soup, proteins, dns strand. Single cell reproducing multiplying. Then 1 of these cells thought â€œill inject my own dna into some other cellâ€, hijack its reproductive system. Very beneficial. So first there were 3 rules: life n death, number of offspring matters and mutation in each generationshift, then with viruses came the 4th rule â€œpowerâ€ â€“ hijacking othersâ€™ reproductive system. Then theres an arms race between viruses and â€¦ â€œOur kind ofâ€ organism, so to mutate our immune system faster two genders arose. Then fights between males led to the dinosaurs. Then brains bonded into groups to fight individualists. Then capitalist power struggles within the group made the brain grow larger, weâ€™re good at planning and remembering things. Then we get to kingdoms. From the water puddle to the 21 st century. Those who proceed to the next era will live in a world where holy book-group bonds are weak and a universal courses group bond is the strongest, thus national wars or civilizational wars where identity is based on other than this science will be impossible. The planet has two future ways to go 60 years from now and one is better but needs some investment of time until everybody knows this course.
Theres a universal course/book thats on every advanced enough planet throughout the universe and at the regeneration of every universe. If you consider the entire corpus of human knowledge, youd find 3 rational starting points: certain truth, nothingness and that reality is one. Just like dinosaurs predate humans the first chapter with the 3 starting points predate the connecting of â€œi think n i exist, distinctionâ€ and â€œreality is one, antidistinction. Which leads to that there is more to reality than can be contemplated meaning that its infinite. Thats chaper 2: like multiplication and division are much higher levels of mathematics than adding and subtracting, chaper 2 is higher than the starting points in chapter 1.
â€”â€”â€”
If you want to be altruistic/selfless you can think about the millions of lives lost or living as refugees due to religious wars and group-loyalties based on ideology/religion. What if group-loyalty could be, for everyone, based on a single universal ideology? Then friendship ties, shared histories, well-mixing personalities and the like would form groups that donÂ´t have a religious mission/an ideological drive. When all ideologies are erased â€“ and religions too â€“ then simple biological mechanisms like common goals, shared interests and family ties bind us together â€“ and those kind of conglomerations are more likely to disintegrate than if there is a holy book or any ideological book as the binding principle between people. If ISIS would be educated then it would disintegrate and many civil wars break out among different families in Iraq/Syria â€“ but there would not be this major cleft between western&modern and holy&dogmatic.
If you want to be selfish like Ayn Rand: the upcoming world order / economy will be a meritocracy based on who advances or knows the most science. The ancient Chinese had a government where even the lowest peasant, if he passed a test in ConfusciousÂ´ teachings, could elevate himself higher in the society. Hierarchy is based on what is objectively to be admired; hierarchy is based on what infinitely many extraterrestrials in consensus have agreed upon be the criteria for how a humanÂ´s thoughts should be wired; hierarchy is based on the universeÂ´s disposition to reward those with the most accurate world-view or whom advance the pre-existing world-view and spread it to others â€“ the universe wants us choose to elevate in the hierarchy those whom appriciate the universe most fully, wholistically and most accurately. The old power-system based on money is upheld by banks and is based on present day humansÂ´ ties to the past. There will be an overlap between the old bank-based system for establishing VIP-status and the new economy which is a meritocracy based on science. If we want to be like planets ahead of us in the evolution of history, we ought to adapt the meritocracy-economy. After a few generations inherited money seems less legitimate than knowing or advancing science and by doing so wiring oneÂ´s cortex (flexible thinking part of the brain) as universally as possible (as much like the consensus among extraterrestrials is as possible).
There are three universal starting points for the universal course which will wire your brain universally. What I mean by â€œuniversalâ€ is that:
A) it is based on science meaning that it is retrievable from anywhere at any time; it is available universally unlike some time-specific language-specific location-specific holy-book-revalation.
B) universal means that it is how aliens/extraterrestrials sooner or later wire their brains. Sure: they can choose to live in a multi-worldviewical world but sooner or later the truth will conquer meaning that all various ideas among every tribe or nation will congregate (like a lens focuses many beams of light into one focal point) into a single set of ideas and prioritarizations â€“ a single world-view will emerge from the many. It is the identical world-view that all civilizing planets will congregate to/toward because science is universal. This congregating is as much of a universal step in evolution as that a planet with water will eventually have bacteria. Eventually everyone will know the course and the idea of this book. â€œWhat do you believe?â€ will no longer be a question because everyone has wired their cortexÂ´s ideas based on universal ideas/science.
â€”â€”â€“
Am I a muslim?
I have my size-time-diagram into which everything fits and this diagram being infinite gives an existential theory because:
â€“ sizes justify (are the cause of) one another, so thereÂ´s infinite justification.
â€“ time is infinite and our universe is observed to become nothingness in the future, and nothingness would be absurd if not for the fact that in the smallest spaces energymass is summoned because E=mc2 is a stable, constant law of nature.
â€“ there can only be separate distinct entities if distinction is counter-balanced and happens in non-distinction (a singular Reality). This point is much like the previous point of that only in nothingness can somethingness be summoned.
God, then, if we are to look for a meaning for the word, cannot be:
â€“ a specific object, size nor time within something infinitely larger
â€“ cannot, by definition, be apart from and â€œbeyondâ€ [that of which all is part] (Reality). Reality being an infinite size- and time-range of energymasspacetime is enough of an existential theory to explain us being here, the Big Bang, and the rest of the questions. God would, if claimed to be â€œbeyondâ€ the existential theory, be an unnecessary unproven assumption but more to the point: God would be â€œunrealâ€ if Reality is defined as we define it here. Such â€œbeyond Realityâ€-gods are unreal. WhatÂ´s more is that the phrase â€œAllah akbarâ€ (God is the biggest/greatest) wouldnÂ´t be true if Reality/[that of which all is part] is God plus Reality â€“ if [that of which all is part] has two major components, God and an energymasspacetime sizerange etc (the existential theory), then the sum of those two components is greater than God.
God, thus, obviously means Reallity by the definition of God being the greatest. God is then infinite. It makes sense to see people in awe over how much they can study, when they know thereÂ´s infinitely many fields of science which we do not have access to but which are logical and necessities for Reality to hold together. There being nothing absurd in an infinite size-range that resembles our known size-range (from quantum physics to the visible universe) is awesome and the highest you could possibly worship. This again proves that God is just a synonym for Reality/the existential theory.
Having studied all fields of science i.e. all sizes is the known sizerange, seeing how they all make up (justify) eachother (that itÂ´s just zooming in and zooming out), the wisdom that the sizerange is infinite (that there are infinitely many sizes making up one another) from the distinction (I think & I am logical path) and anti-distinction (that Reality is one) -thing, is the reason why we exist and God is not some size (sizes are not minds, except through evolution). Having studied all known sizes and knowing that the sizerange is infinite: it is an explanation to why weÂ´re here (akin to the Adam and Eve story or â€œGod created earth in 6 daysâ€ story) but it is not a revalation-giving thing â€“ the Quran wasnÂ´t written by God because God is not the kind of thing that writes/dictates stories. God being an infinite sizerange as thus our Creator is true, but the true way to get knowledge, rituals/pictoral representations and even guidance is through my work, not the work of the holy book-writers. The holy book writers might have said something true about God (just like I do in my work) â€“ but that is true of science textbooks moreso â€“ and they all said false things such as that God talks/gives revalations/authors holy books.
I can see the bronze-age marketing-teamÂ´s standpoint: people are more prone to follow dictates if theyÂ´re said to come from something/someone â€œhigher than humanâ€ i.e. a God or a ghost/spirit. Being invisible in as nonsense-a-way as some rituals are, is great for marketing. Everyone knows how humans thing â€“ theyÂ´re themselves human; we are only partly rational (a computer is rational) in what we think â€“ all our animal lusts bias or interrupt the thoughts that are as logical as they get, but theyÂ´re always going to be based against an evolutionary background just like the pitfall that my abstract diagram-including infinity-mentioning world-view is more like algebra than â€œwhat a world-view (context in which we are) should be thinking about that we lived for millions of years on the savannah, only needing to know (in oneÂ´s world-view) where the water-source is or whom stands under whom in the social hierarchy. WeÂ´ve mapped geographies, the use-based properties of objects/tools and personalities (and still do) for a gazillion years â€“ only with the advent of science SOME of us achieved higher i.e. used their evolved meager toolkit with all its biases to scetch out something like the theory of evolution in the 1800s. Looking at the evolution of [what we use our memory for]/how we map our surroundings/our world-view, before we mapped social relationships we mapped geographies. Before we mapped the functions of inventions (tools) our map only contained caveman tools (sharp stones and spears). The next step is to map oneÂ´s context as an infinite size-time-diagram (where size and time are really the same, but abstract thinking allows us to separate them into two distinct axises) or energymasspacetime (with itsÂ´ many laws of nature found in every school textbook in the world) and the distinction-antidistinction-
thing which feels so awkward/abstract that one wonders why one needs it as pillar 3 of the existential theory: the answer is: it wasnÂ´t invented (the words â€œI see a distinct objectâ€ or â€œwhy is there distinction?â€ werenÂ´t said in the same breath as â€œReality is oneâ€ or â€œenergymass and spacetime uniteâ€) until I did it in the 21st century). It might seem trivial to mention that separate entities exist in a singular Reality â€“ itÂ´s so obvious (thatÂ´s why no-one cared to make a big fuzz out of inventing it) but it makes the existential theory have three pillars (all of which can seem obvious) and not 4 â€“ thereÂ´s nothing more to add to the existential theory once youÂ´ve added the obvious â€œseparation in antidistinctionâ€-statement. I want to know how aliens (the infinitely many of them, steered by science toward an incommon path) think because its synonymous to finding a TRUE â€œkey to historyâ€ (Marx thought the key was equality, Hitler thought the key was racial superiority and a brutally competative relationship between races, Capitalism thinks itÂ´s freedom (less government), some might think they â€œkey to historyâ€ is to fund technological development). â€œHow aliens thinkâ€ is a shorthand way of saying â€œthe key to historyâ€ or â€œwhat will happen next/eventually and in hindsight seen as akin to the era of ancient grecoroman culture, the Industrial Revolution or the Digital revolution)â€. ItÂ´s what weÂ´re steered towards; itÂ´s the closest thing we get to divine guidance. ItÂ´s simply universal (drawn on science and practiced by infinitely many aliens) guidance/suggestions/
recommendations that we, as a species, can choose to promogate and thus â€œfollowâ€ or if weÂ´ll stick to multiculturalismÂ´s many -ismÂ´s like political quran-based islamism or christian-based â€œthe holy book gave me thisâ€-morality and codes of conduct. Some -ismÂ´s are dangerous (like quran-based politics and law) while some -ismÂ´s like christianity give too much credit to the -ism for simple human decency (in an age of extreme wealth globally). When my tummy is full IÂ´m a decent person â€“ I try to make money but IÂ´m not desparate after extreme wealth because I know that my caveman-brainÂ´s â€œneedâ€ for power (through status-symbols and freedom of space my environment to maximize the effectiveness of my hobby (writing)) wonÂ´t get satisfied no matter what external extravaganzas trigger my eyeballs, nor can people (socializing) make me much more satisfied than I am right now because all that is interesting and that there is to people is their brain â€“ and after a few weeks together thereÂ´ll be nothing I know nor any mental tool that I use that wonÂ´t, despite copyright, be in the hands of my friend: we wonÂ´t talk science (me teaching him/her) after all the science has been taught. I donÂ´t care to teach trivia so when I say â€œI teach SCIENCEâ€ I mean a finite thing: the existential theory plus something from each level of the known sizerange. Getting a P.hD from specializing on finding the structure of a rare protein only found in the feet of Amazonian forrest-mice is to put your eyes too close to the diagram; P.hDs for specializing/having a very narrow topic for oneÂ´s mind to engage in are for people who donÂ´t see the forest for the trees and care to rather look at one leaf of one tree instead of thinking about and seeing the forest as a whole. IÂ´m a forest person â€“ a leaf 10 cm from my eyes just bugs me. ThatÂ´s why there is a finite repertoire to what I call â€œscienceâ€ â€“ it takes a few days for me (my accomplishment/my work) to be fully understood and if repeated repetative. One only needs to know why/where one exists (the existential theory) once â€“ one canÂ´t forget it because we are made to remember the very context in which we live (here an evolutionary bias helps us: when someone explains â€œwhat the world isâ€ we remember it because â€œwhat the world wasâ€ in caveman days was the most useful thing the brain could do â€“ in fact we evolved such large brains because bigger brains remember better (can moreso map social relationships, successfull or unsuccesfull learning-experiences). We want to climb upwards in the hierarchy, find a mate, etc but all these wants and needs would be useless (theyÂ´d having nothing to work on) if it werenÂ´t for the map (of social relationships etc) that our brain is capable of remembering. We are inclined to remember existential theories because such knowledge about our place in the context was as useful as mapping whom is married to whom. This bias, by the way, is something holy book writers used to get people interested in their book. â€œGod created earth in 6 days (not 5)â€ is memorable because of our bias toward wanting to know about â€œcreation of the worldâ€ â€“ so the number â€œ6 daysâ€ is remembered too because it adds to the map that we then work on to seek power and other evolutionary benefits. ItÂ´s hard to make plans that have one reach evolutionary benefits if one does not know oneÂ´s environment/the external world. â€œ6 days for creating this place/worldâ€ adds to oneÂ´s map of the environment/place/external world. We have a bias for remembering it. Too bad the bronze-age holy books used this marketing trick (â€œhey, letÂ´s say something about their world (like the creation of it) because that would be something they remember!â€) to give pseudo- existential theories. The holy books made sales because not only do people want information about their context, people also want God to talk and interfere with day-to-day personal activites. Once you have a pseudo-explanation for how/why the world was created, youÂ´re free to add to that pseudo-explanation that â€œthe creator talksâ€. ItÂ´s impossible to add such a talking thing to my existential theory â€“ not only is it unnecessary (my theory works stand-alone) but it also contradicts basically every concept of my existential theory. The very definitions of energymasspacetime (meaning that God had nothingness as the canvas to paint on â€“ a nothingness that needs energymass and summons it because of the laws of nature inherent in that nothingness â€“ and chose to paint a beginning with as-dense-as-can-be (just like E=mc2 wouldÂ´ve created it because E=mc2 is true in the smallest spaces). Where was God when this happened? CouldnÂ´t have been energymass because energymass is only summoned once the universe becomes pure nothingness. If God is not energymass and energymass is existence â€“ then God doesnÂ´t exist / God is nothing. What doesnÂ´t exist or is nothing doesnÂ´t give revalations to men, doesnÂ´t care whom you sleep with, etc. Is God or GodÂ´s heaven a location in our size of infinite spacetime? In that case God is simply a far-away alien (which warrants questions about its evolution) but again â€“ it doesnÂ´t talk to us because of the distance and we wouldnÂ´t be too impressed even if an evolved God did talk to us (we are quite like it â€“ our science is the same, our world-view is the same). God is not a location in a size but is God a size? The sizerange is infinite (as proven by distinction not being able to see antidistinction) and thatÂ´d mean that thereÂ´s a creator to God (and that thing too has a creator, ad infinitum) IN THE SAME WAY as humans built cities or atoms make molecules. Again, if God is a size it warrantÂ´s the question: is God every location of that size or is God, like humans, in a location of that size? Whatever be the case, God still couldnÂ´t communicate with us. Since God fits neither in the context of energymasspacetime nor the context of the sizerange, a God-theory absolutely contradicts the true theory. What is said about God â€“ that God is the greatest â€“ makes only one â€œlocationâ€/notion in the existential theory correspond to a non-talking uncaring God: the theory itself (and more precisely Reality/[that of which all is part]) is the greatest. It certainly doesnÂ´t hear/talk nor give revalations because it comes as an infinite sizerange of energymasspacetime. When you tell this science, you can get to the point where you define Reality as â€œthat of which all is partâ€ and the greatest â€“ you can even get to antidistinction/the unrepresentability of Reality (fully, because we do represent some things) and people might still hope that a talking God can exist. But as soon as you mention the less abstract (the more abstract was that [that of which all is part cannot be observed]), the God-theory either surrenders or is in conflict with a/the existential theory which certainly is true (anyone can verify how the components of the theory fit together, make sense and explain everything). God as a synonym for Reality is boring â€“ why do we even have two words if we mean the same (scientific sizerange) thing.
If you assume that God is a synonym for Reality (which comes as an infinite sizescale, which in turn predicts a DNA-strand somewhere and voila: everything is explained), then I believe in your God. It doesnÂ´t appriciate my appriciation of it though, nor do rituals, following rules (made by men) etc please it. If I am to â€œshow my appriciation to itâ€ I do it by writing as I do right now â€“ thatÂ´s my worship of it: but IÂ´m under no illusion that this writing would please God by being logical (eventhough Reality itself is logical too â€“ so we have something incommon) â€“ me writing can be called worship but the only appriciating recipients of my writing are me and readers of my text. Whatever I write about Reality/God doesnÂ´t please God (because God is not a thing that listens, likes worship by others and other human needs) â€“ whatever worshippers do, I hope they do it for themselves and for other humans because no-one else is able to care or comprehend the worship. I would do the muslim prayer if I felt that that kind of discipline would benefit me (and a few times I did get a good feeling from going to the mosque and being among worshippers). ItÂ´s so easy to adapt to the customs of oneÂ´s peers (and especially oneÂ´s superiors, if one believes that there are those) that my attitude toward worship/ritual is â€œwhen in Rome, do like the romans (if you or others gain something out of it)â€. The world is complex â€“ I could have the same attitude toward the beliefs of islam: that IÂ´ll just say that something is through eventhough it obviously isnÂ´t because it contradicts, say, a talking holy book-writing God. Could I make myself believe that something talkative is God? The belief disintegrates and I get the foul feeling of that IÂ´ve used my valuable memory to note down a lie everytime I would think just one step/association further from the belief itself. I can believe (in anything) but analyzing it even the smallest amount will make me disbelieve it. But when youÂ´re in the mood of not analyzing â€“ like when one is having a panic attack on oneÂ´s death-bed â€“ IÂ´ll be (extremely) simplistic and do what some people seem to always do: â€œbelieve (in something that breaks down when analyzed)â€. What confuses me is that some people believe all the time â€“ they seem perfectly sane but they believe in a talking, scripture-giving God (that doesnÂ´t fit anywhere in the existential theory). Do they need comfort (from untruth) all the time? It seems like theyÂ´re trying to argue their position, though. A perplexing phenomenon at first glance but when you consider that theyÂ´re uneducated about my existential theory, any theory will do (even a talking God-theory). I am not hateful of it when I see it in other people â€“ I see it as humorous/ridicilous â€“ but when it binds people together (to form what in essence is an army) and thereÂ´s many of them (10 000 religions/â€armiesâ€) the worldÂ´s got a problem. Binding people together through their shared scripture and their belief that something impossible is true is bad because groups tend to be more violent than individualists â€“ especially if their holy text 1) seems to bind billions of people to their army (morale-strength amplification in a group is the root of violence), and 2) preaches violence/disrespect (many holy books are xenophobic and eager to create an â€œus vs. themâ€-social dynamic). If the holy book is taken seriously (if it canÂ´t be thrown in the trash) then we have bronze-age xenophobia (based on who likes the book and who doesnÂ´t) creeping into the modern day, and we also have artificial bonding/loyalty â€“ we basically get groups who are hostile (or more disrespectful) toward anyone who doesnÂ´t see the point (â€œthereÂ´s a talking Godâ€) theyÂ´re promoting. ItÂ´s such an easily fixable problem: if you read my work you simply cannot believe in a talking God â€“ my professional role is that you can give me ANY individual and I can â€œconvertâ€ him/her into not believing in a talking God. Whether this person will follow his or her groupÂ´s rituals or codes of conduct, though, is up to them â€“ itÂ´s sheer peer pressure.
The â€œus vs. themâ€ â€œwe are a big groupâ€ (and especially) â€œwe should convert the whole world so that they use their precious memory for knowing nonsense like we doâ€ are such great reasons for violence â€“ and of course itÂ´s fixable because what these people lack is education: only where there is no theory, can a pseudo-theory take root. Only where there is no argument/debate/science can â€œGod talksâ€ seem like legitimate truth. This means that much of the worldÂ´s violence is due to a lack of education (about the big questions i.e. what I talk about). Sure: some religions can be interpreted to say â€œkill the infidelsâ€ or some other explicit declaration of war â€“ but itÂ´s hard for a religion to survive if it constantly preaces fighting (it must have more clever tactics than that â€“ but it does tend to seek world-dominion). IÂ´m not so worried that someone reads the Quran and thinks â€œIÂ´ll help the [unbelieves in the QuranÂ´s talking God] to get to hell faster, because the Quran says that thatÂ´s where they belongâ€. I am worried about that the Quran (or any holy book) is the glue that binds people together. Religion is the last glue before we enter an era where obviously arbitrary things like nationalism or language makes strangers feel more familiar with eachother. Nation and language arenÂ´t taken that seriously â€“ nor should religion be, but it is. This binding-effect that holy books have is what makes ISIS / the taliban etc so hard to defeat â€“ they think, not only that they have an all-seeing revalation-giving God on their side, but they also have the exact same copy of a book that a billion people have. They feel strong (with their, seemingly to them, superior numbers). Obviously ISIS underestimated the ability of the Quran to draw in arab nations into the fight over Iraq & Syria â€“ the modern world simply leaned on the fact that ISIS are not muslims because they interpret the bronze-age ramble wrong. But ISIS / the taliban is still a factor â€“ the quran binds too many people together in certain areas of the world â€“ violence is caused, due to the binding-effect, the â€œmoral superiorityâ€-effect, the â€œpower in numbers and billions of people read the Quranâ€-effect etc (all these effects are there even if you skip the parts about the talking God who word for word said the Quran) make men as prone to violence as anything can make them: theyÂ´re a group with an â€œus vs. themâ€ dogma & feeling and they feel like they have power in numbers. Add to that the frustration over having to finance an own home before one can ejaculate. Those circumstances can make the group take up arms and â€œsend the infidels where they belongâ€. Following the commandments frustrates, the whole notion of â€œletÂ´s all prioritize this text highest (our favorite book) so that weÂ´re bound togetherâ€ and that the text itself can be interpreted as violent all are a breeding-ground for trouble â€“ and when youÂ´re in the trouble that the text creates, you are not in the state of mind to do the internal debate necessary to disprove a talking God and thus make your whole way of life become something that you either do as meaningless fun or donÂ´t do because no-one cares. But just as some people want to become professional soccer players and some atheists do zen-meditation, humans (by personal preference) want hobbies, to take up a discipline, to do something that adds, say, pride to their life. I donÂ´t personally care about soccer and I donÂ´t feel pride from doing any ritual, but I can definitely see that others take the muslim prayers like an athlete takes their sport. ItÂ´s possible to find out the objective truth about whether these prayers â€œplease God or notâ€ (by, like IÂ´ve done in this text, disproving all kinds of false Gods and making the real God more mundane and not a talker). Rituals donÂ´t please Reality/â€the energymasspacetime sizerangeâ€ because it is not a thing that gets pleased â€“ itÂ´s like trying to please a rock. You do the prayers because you enjoy the pride/hobby for its own sake â€“ like someone doing sports likes his/her sport. Pleasing a rock/God to get to a â€œheavenâ€ (which too doesnÂ´t fit into the true existential theory) is stupid unless itÂ´s akin to a hobby/sport where you do it for doing itÂ´s sake. Same thing with the â€œheaven hates hamâ€-thing â€“ when you know enough science (enough = what IÂ´ve written so far in this text) youÂ´ll realize that the whole ham-prohibition is man-made (from the bronze age) and linked to some pre-scientific nonsense from-the-horseÂ´s-mouth-
statement (canÂ´t say rationale because itÂ´s dogma). If you (and secondarily your peers) are dedicated to nonsense (whether it be sports, stamp-collecting, memorizing capitals or not eating pork), then do it if it does something good like prove to yourself (and others) that you have a strong discipline (even though your effort is misdirected toward nonsense). I can invent a ritual and do it every day, and maybe IÂ´d feel pride over that I can keep to a schedule of nonsense, but I would never claim the theory that there is a talking God, and by extention I wouldnÂ´t say that that ficticious talker prohibited ham. The mundane action must be differentiated from the logical argument. Ham-prohibitions and talking Gods are artifacts that belong in the past â€“ modern white A4-paper is too beautiful for someone to write something as erroneous as â€œthere is a talking Godâ€ on it. But as IÂ´m writing this, people are dying because religion binds them together (and frustrates them, and boosts their war-morale in many ways). My work can cause a civil war within ISIS â€“ a civil rift so permiating that only family ties, friendships and common goals (to get money, not to spread islam) can keep people together in groups. Once my existential theory is known there will still be crime and instability in Iraq, Syria and Afghanistan, but the evil deeds will only be committed by groups of 2-3 people â€“ not 20 000 of them. The binding effect of the Quran can most clearly be seen in that internet-propaganda made Quran-readers from the USA and Europe go fight in Syria â€“ everyone wants a group and itÂ´s totally human to assume that knowing the same book will be enough for a bond to be as strong as one wants it to be.
Right now â€œmy workâ€ is 9 proper texts and a few videos. They all talk about the same thing (which can be formulated as: IÂ´ll say as much as I can about things IÂ´ve never heard anyone else say (and IÂ´ve seen the best professors in the world teaching truths)). To cause a rift in the taliban/ISIS and stop the war by making group-bonding (around a holy book) problematic/impossible, my whole â€œworkâ€ doesnÂ´t need to be dropped as propaganda books on top of ISIS and the taliban. ItÂ´s enough that the news headlines say that â€œa correct all-explaining existential theory has been found â€“ religions in crysisâ€ or that enough people know my theory so that a multitude of youtube videos are made where, in a sentence or two, the presenter goes off-topic and mentions why we exist / something from my theory. Having understood it once makes it impossible to forget â€“ having understood it once makes group-bonding over religion (which fuels ISIS/the taliban/etc) impossible. If the world could just take 20 minutes of itsÂ´ time to spend on explaining/teaching/arguing my work/theory, then the war on terror would be over â€“ otherwise it will persist as long as people have no actual, logical theory about their existence and thus believe in bronze-age marketing tricks.
â€”â€”-
The theory of evolution begins with the first reproducing shape. It was a shape that assembled surrounding mass into a similar shape. The existential theory predicts the existence of infinitely many such shapes. What inevitable becomes true when you have reproduction is that some die and some survive (life and death), that the number of offspring that shape make matters and that there is mutations over time. This is true about the shapeÂ´s offspring: some will die and some will survive, the number of offspring they make matters and the offspring can be different from the original shape. These three rules / laws of nature were inactive before the first reproduction occurred. The next main event was that one of these shapes found that if it injected its DNA into other shapesÂ´ reproductive mechanism, it exploited principle number two: that the number of offspring matters. It was the first virus: it hijacked othersÂ´ reproduction. The rule / law of nature that came into play with this event was that â€œpowerâ€ matters: hijacking othersÂ´ reproductive mechanism gives evolutionary benefits. Now weÂ´ve listed the four main rules that govern evolutionary theory: first came the three first, and then came the forth: power. The next main event â€“ to guard against viruses taking over all life / reproductive mechanisms â€“ was that an immune system evolved to protect against virusÂ´ hijack attempts. This required multicellularism. Just like immune systems prompt/require multicellularism, immune systems prompt/require multigenderedism: to win in the arms race against quickly mutating viruses two genders arose to amplify the mutations to the immune system. Mixing genes from two genders creates a more mutated immune system, which can keep ahead in the arms race against quickly-mutating viruses â€œtryingâ€ to mutate to bypass any immune system. The next main event is that one of these multicellular organisms â€“ a fish or worm â€“ of the male gender mutated to be agressive and defeat other males in battle. He wouldÂ´ve gotten access to many more females than his non-agressive counter-parts. This too can be called â€œpowerâ€ because the agressive male hijacks other maleÂ´s access to females by killing the males. This prompts the dinosaurs because larger muscle mass and shaper weaponry is better at killing off competitors. Amongst the dinosaurs there was the mother-offspring bond, placed there by evolution for the evolutionary benefits a mother gets from seeing an offspring survive to adulthood. This bond mutated to involve flock-members because a group working together out-competes any individualists when fighting over anything. The next main event was that someone mapped the flock, in his brain, as a hierarchy (up-down-axis) with the longing to dominate peers.

Dude, evolution has me try to maximize evolutionary benefits using my plans; im always thinking at full speed and pain drives that thinking. And i know for certain that all this pain is meaningless. Its a suicide recipe but what prevents me from suicide is the natural strength that stems from being the pinnacle of beasts who all have survived for generations.

New book 2017
Chapter 1:
What problem does this solve?
This solves a problem that becomes most visible 60 years from now when sea-levels rise, the economy goes into permanent decline and oil ends. ThatÂ´s when humans start to fight (and belong in world-view-based groups to do so). While the economy is still rising the clashes are few and far between â€“ Afghanistan, Syria, ISISÂ´ world-wide terror attacks (mainly muslim world-views clashing with tolerant world-views). When the economy starts declining thereÂ´ll naturally be more friction between groups, and groups are made up of world-views (people identify as in a group based on world-view).
Advancing the scientific world-view to the level where it explains our origin and thus invades religious intellectual turf, solves the problem of world-views colliding as war.
Chapter 2:
Certain truth â€“ I think & I am
You have a composite certain truth consisting of two certain truths: you can claim as certain that you think (because if you were being fooled: being fooled is thinking) and that you exist (because being fooled requires the one who is fooled to be there). I think and I exist is one statement but two truths. You can certainly claim to have â€œdistinctionâ€ because youÂ´re dealing with multiple separate distinct entities (such as â€œIâ€ and â€œthoughtâ€). One could put it, while seeing the certain truths â€œI thinkâ€ and â€œI existâ€, that the space between the two notions (thinker and thought) is the hallmark of distinction. The distance separating thinker from thought we can recognize as necessary for â€œdistinctionâ€ to be concluded as a certain truth arising, in a next logical step, from the original primary certain truth.
Everyone agrees they they themselves exist, because if one would get fooled in everyone one can be fooled in then one would exist there anyway and be fooled. So one knows that one exists. Then one also knows that one thinks because â€œto get fooledâ€ is a thought-process. Thus we have two things: I think and I exist. And the distinction between them: and on the flipside of the paper we have the opposite of that: anti-distinction, and this can also be called â€œthat of which all is partâ€/Reality. And since we are in the distinction-side of the paper when we see something; when we see something there is distinction between us and that thing. Thus we cannot represent or see that which is on the other side of the paper i.e. that of which all is part / Reality. Nothing can represent â€“ because it is distinct â€“ Reality. So whatever which is distinct cannotâ€¦ whatever that is observed or represented is distinct and therefore is notâ€¦ therefore does not represent Reality / â€œthat of which all is partâ€. So we have distinction and anti-distinction as opposing poles.
You have a certain truth which everyone in the whole world agrees upon. You think and you exist since if you were being fooled by an almighty demon youÂ´d still both think and exist. Then there are two things i.e. distinction. All is part of a single reality which is anti-distinction, there are no separate parts: reality is one. If we put distinction on the left side of the paper and anti-distinction on the right side then (we) distinction cannot see that of which all is part because â€œto seeâ€ is â€œto representâ€ and then one uses something to refer to reality. There is nothing outside reality which can refer to reality but instead reality is defined as â€œthat of which all is partâ€ and then there is nothing that can refer to all of reality. The opposition between the two sides of the paper (distinction & anti-distinction) makes reality as â€œthat of which all is partâ€-anti-distinction non-representable because representation always involves distinction. What we see, for example, is just parts of reality. The hypotheses can be infinitely much so there is infinitely much to reality. Sizes and times, that is. In the existential theory (â€œwhy we existâ€) there, thus, is an infinite size-range with time, energymass in spacetime (everything and nothing intertwined like in the E=mc2 equation â€“ energy equals mass times, well â€“ spacetime; multiplication is what unites energymass with spacetime). Then we have distinction and anti-distinction: separate things but all is part of a single reality. The existential theory with its three pillars, that is an infinite sizerange, energymasspacetime and distinction-anti-distinction-opposition, predicts that there should be a tiny piece of DNA which copies itself.
Then thereÂ´s another kind of revelation that got respect. Descartes who lived in the 1600s got respect, fame and was invited to live with the Queen of Sweden because he had gotten an idea which certainly told us something true. Revelations can either be con menÂ´s statements like they were from ape-man and forward, or they can actually claim something which is verifyably true. Descartes, propably having his mind overcrowded by the masses of revelations that had accumulated to his time, asked: â€œwhat would be true if all my statements were false?â€. What would remain if I tossed all my knowledge and ideas into the trash? Are we stuck with countless unverifyable statements, some contradicting eachother, not knowing which ones are true and which ones are not? Obviously not since statements about architecture are obviously true since they build houses, while contradictory statements do not. So Descartes dared to throw all his knowledge in the trash to see what remained. He found certain truth: that he exists â€“ because even if he was wrong or was being fooled in everything he thought to be true, thereÂ´d still be a â€œheâ€ there. He certainly exists no matter what. Same thing goes for thoughts: being wrong or being fooled is a thinking-process so even if he was wrong or was being fooled in everything he thought, thereÂ´d still be thought.
Socrates: So he figured out that he thinks and he exists.
God: These are not one statement â€“ they are two.
Socrates: What does that mean?
God: IÂ´ll tell you later â€“ just agree with me that there is distinction between thinker and thought â€“ that the statements are two. ItÂ´s building on certain truth, and itÂ´s possible to build a wholeâ€¦ whatever it is that â€œsaves the worldâ€ from the coming economic decline by having everyone build on certain truth until the God-debate is settled. Remembering â€œdistinctionâ€ (between thinker and thought) will prevent the horror-scenario of large-scale future wars between people group-bound by religions, and instead â€“ since everyone built a whole world-view on certain truth â€“ have a more stable decline in the future. â€œDistinctionâ€ i.e. remembering that there are two certain truths (thinker and thought) is a step on the way toward a plan that will save humanity from destroying itself as much as it would if we didnÂ´t build our world-views on certain truth.
Plato: So after an era of â€œrevelationâ€-revelations invented by anyone for whatever purpose, coming from DarwinÂ´s ape-manÂ´s revelations, Descartes, in the 1600s, invented a revelation â€“ certain truth: I think and I exist â€“ which got him invited to the Queen of Sweden for the rest of his life. People have always liked revelations and even verifyable truth-claims like DescartesÂ´ get respect.
God: I have set it as true that each one of you humans can verify in your own mindÂ´s eye that you do certainly exist and that there certainly is thought â€“ and thus there is distinction.
Darwin: Distinction is an abstract word. That two objects are separate/different from one another is one of those notions and ape-man never made into language â€“ there was never the evolutionary need to talk about â€œdistinctionâ€. Yes: one could say that one banana is different from another (and one wants the bigger one), but to have Distinction exist stand-alone as a distinct notion is abstract thinking and we are not evolved to do that. For millions of years the caveman word for â€œdistinctionâ€ was only used in a sentance â€“ not stand-alone as in â€œdistinction certainly exists because thinker and thought are both certain truthsâ€.
Chapter 3:
Distinction-antidistinction-opposition
The first proof for that the size-time-diagram is infinite is distinctionÂ´s (our) inability to see/represent anti-distinction.
Chapter 4:
Maximum size?
The second prooof for that the size-time-diagram is infinite is that if we imagine a partless anti-distinction then it has no distinction as in a â€œmaximumâ€ or â€œminimumâ€ size, i.e. the size-range is infinite.
Chapter 5:
Infinite size-time-diagram
Chapter 6:
Existential theoryÂ´s 3 pillars
Chapter 7:
Prediction of DNA

You know for certain that you think and that you exist because even if an almighty demon was fooling you in everything you can possibly be fooled in, the fooling itself is a thought-process and therefore you know that thought exists (you think), and for you to be fooled you have to exist and therefore you know "I exist". Being fooled is thinking and a thinker is necessary for there to be someone to be fooled. So you know: no matter what, you think and you exist. Those are two things, right? TheyÂ´re both part of the same brain and the thought-process can become the analytical toolkit/thinker, but still we recognize that there are distinct entities - there is distinction. This can also be called separation. What is distinctionÂ´s opposite, anti-distinction? ItÂ´s one reality; that of which all is part; itÂ´s one and realityÂ´s definition in the dictionary is that all is part of it. If we write distinction (thinker and thought) on the left side of the paper and anti-distinction (reality; that of which all is part; one) on the right side of the paper - can the left side see the right side? No, because of opposition between distinction and anti-distinction. Because of there always being an observer (a thinker) and thus distinction in every observation and thus anti-distinction canÂ´t be represented/seen.
The brain evolved to deal with natural occurances - there was never an event in history where something invisible was to be contemplated and dealt with. Thus we seem to assume that the thought-process went wrong when we say that distinction/us canÂ´t see anti-distinction/reality. But the thought-process didnÂ´t go wrong: all that it means is that there is more to reality than can be represented. Regardless of how vaguely "represents" is defined, say a coffee cup - regardless of brains being involved - is assumed to try to represent that of which all is part, then anti-dinstinction - distinction - opposition (the opposition between distinction and itÂ´s opposite) makes the representation incorrect. We can ask if there in an anti-distinct "thing" is a maximum size and thus distinction? No. Likewise, another proof for that the size-range is infinite is that we do sense something (our everyday world) and can make hypotheses ad infinitum, and yet nothing represent
s ALL OF reality. Reality i.e. s
ize-time thus is infinite.
The infinite size-range is one pillar in the existential theory. Another pillar is energymass and spacetime being opposites but intertwined as in E=mc
2
(where c
2
refers to a speed which is space over time: spacetime). Multiplication joins energymass together with spacetime; nothing together with something/everything; existence together with non-existence. Why is there existence the shape of my body? Without going into the historical answer, one can explain it by saying that the body is something in (intertwined with) nothing, of a size in an infinite size-range (where the relationship between any two sizes (or objects of two sizes) i
s that they make sense of i.e. j
ustify one another). Then there too, as a third pillar, is distinction-an
ti-distinction-opposition i.e. w
e live in a single (not plural) reality but we see distinct/separate entities such as thinker and thought.
Speaking of spacetime, spacetime is the logical starting point for the time-based existential theory.
Nothingness (empty space) needs n
o prior justification nor reason to exist, because it doesnÂ´t exist. In it, however
, laws of nature are true i.e. i
t is not irrational / anti-logical, and among the many laws of nature there are those, including E=mc
2
, which mention energymass.
Could energymass be "mentioned" without it existing? If yes, it would be absurd / anti-logical. Why would reality mention things that never exist? But since laws of nature are firm and because of our rule "what is mentioned must exist or must be summoned" we get, wherever (in the smallest spaces) that E=mc
2
is mentioned, existence and thus dense existence: a big bang. The fact that galaxies are speeding away acceleratingly from one another leads to nothingness in the future, and with the middleman "laws of nature" again energymass is summoned as dense as can be. No time-delay between nothingness - laws of nature - energymass but as soon as a bordered (by event horizons which are determined by the finite speed of light) region becomes nothingness, a big bang occurs and eventually becomes nothingness bordered by event horizons again. This is the time-wise description of why energymass (which exists intertwined with spacetime as in E=mc
2
) starts dense and becomes nothingness, and repeats.
All of the above is a rival theory to "God created earth in 6 days and rested on the 7th". It is unintuitive because it deals with things we didnÂ´t have to deal with in evolution: invisible energymasspacetime/reality/anti-distinction as a part of reasoning. It also has a multi-reason cause for our existence: a time-wise rationale involving the beginning and end of the big bang combined with a 3-pillar existential theory which justifies size and energymass. It is abstract/scientific but canÂ´t be reduced into simpler terms. ItÂ´s the lowest common denominator that everyone can believe in (regardless of religion).
How many is reality? One. How many is Allah? One. Can anything completely represent reality? No. Can anything completely represent Allah? No. Is reality the greatest (if all is part of it)? Yes. Is â€œAllah akbarâ€? Yes. Reality and Allah have these three things incommon â€“ so maybe reality is synonymous with Allah?
How vaguely has reality defined â€to representâ€?
Infinitely vaguely â€“ anything can represent anything.
Is the representation/representer reality or Allah?
No.
Can anything represent that of which all is part?
No.
Then the size-time-diagram is infinite i.e. nothing represents reality. How many is it? How many is Allah? 1.
Did it sayâ€¦, or did it wri
te a book?
This disproves Allah writing the Quran.
Again: how much of reality can be represented by, say, a painting? The whole of it?
No, the whole of reality cannot be represented. Just like Allah canÂ´t be captured in a picture/word.
We can have hypotheses â€“ how many hypotheses can we have?
If reality is sizes & times, energymass and spacetime then the square-shaped size-time-diagram with energymasspacetime in each coordinate is the universal way to represent all there is to represent.
Does it write books? No, it is not of such authorship-kind nature.
â€œGod said to Muhammed word by wordâ€¦â€ is thus a false or at most metaphorical statement.
â€œYou have to do rituals in order not to go to hell, and in heaven you get 72 virginsâ€ is by the same logic also a false claim.
There are three alternatives as the foundation for this logic â€“ can you think of a 4
th
one?
1: Reality is a synonym for Allah
2: or Allah doesnÂ´t exist
3: or there are 72 virgins (not an alternative because reality is not of the nature, because it is size-time-energymasspacetime, to write books).
In addition to the square size-time diagram with infinity symbols in each of itÂ´s corners, and the evolutionary triangle which designates that life becomes more complex as time goes on
(the triangle originates at the central size of the known size-range), there is the following brain diagram:
You have a composite certain truth consisting of two certain truths: you can claim as certain that you think (because if you were being fooled: being fooled is thinking) and that you exist (because being fooled requires the one who is fooled to be there). I think and I exist is one statement but two truths. You can certainly claim to have â€œdistinctionâ€ because youÂ´re dealing
with multiple separate distinct entities (such as â€œIâ€ and â€œthoughtâ€). One could put it, while seeing the certain truths â€œI thinkâ€ and â€œI existâ€, that the space between the two notions (thinker and thought) is the hallmark of distinction. The distance separating thinker from thought we can recognize as necessary for â€œdistinctionâ€ to be concluded as a certain truth arising, in a next logical step, from the original primary certain truth.
Are all distinct entities part of a single reality if â€œrealityâ€ is defined as â€œthat of which all is partâ€? In other words: if we draw distinction on the left side of a paper and anti-distinction (distinctionÂ´s opposite: a singular reality â€“ that of which all is part. Zooming out summarizing maximally) on the right side of the paper, then can distinction represent the right side of the paper i.e. anti-distinction? How could some distinct entities depict the very opposite of what representation/distinction is? Any depiction/representation of anti-distinction/reality has at least three entities: thinker, space between thinker and thought, and thought. Separation/distinction is inherent in representation, thus anti-distinction is unrepresentable.
How vaguely has the universe/God defined what a representation is i.e. when a representation occurs? Our brains use neurons to represent, but what if â€“ instead of neurons (regardless of brains) â€“ the universe wills that any random object can be said to, as neurons do, represent reality? The universe has defined â€œrepresentationâ€ infinitely vaguely i.e. disregarding brains, any random object spontaneously is the symbol standing for all of reality â€“ because the universe defines â€œrepresentsâ€ infinitely vaguely. Despite the infinitely vague definition of what represents what, distinction-anti-distinction-opposition (the line separating the left side of the paper from the right side; the countering of distinction with anti-distinction) means that reality is not representable. If reality is anti-distinction then no distinction (representation is inherently distinction) can even, despite an infinitely vague definition of â€œrepresentsâ€, capture reality.
In
representations we can count at least three things and what weÂ´re trying to capture is one thing with nothing outside it. The fact that representations contain distinction makes capturing reality (all is one) impossible.
We can have infinitely many or infinitely large/substancefull representations/hypotheses â€“ such as an infinite size-time-diagram â€“ and though abstractly accurately pointing to reality, the universeÂ´s rule that nothing represents reality despite infinitely vaguely allowed representations of infinitely much, makes reality unrepresentable. This can only mean one thing: reality â€“ which we know as sizes and times (a size-time-diagram) â€“ is infinite. ThereÂ´s infinitely large and infinitely small with infinitely much past and infinitely much future. This square-shaped size-time-diagram i.e. our everyday experience of size-time has infinities all-over the place.
Energymass in spacetime: one in zero, existence in non-existence, something in nothing â€“ as defined by E=mc
2
where c
2
stands for speed (distance over time i.e. spacetime/zero/non-existence) and E=m referring to energymass (existence, something, all).
Distinction-anti-distinction-opposition: we live in a singular reality but we see multiple objects.
An infinite size-range.
The above three ideas are an existential theory (a theory which explains the existence of a reproducing shape and thus the dawn of evolution and thus our existence). It is modern to utilize three equal ideas to explain oneÂ´s existence â€“ all previous existential theories used either a single idea (monotheism) or a saga (multiple mundane (not very scientific/abstract) ideas) to explain existence.
The predictive quality that makes this existential theory a scientific theory is that it, basing it off an infinite size-range of energymasspacetime and distinction-anti-distinction-opposition, predicts that in an infinite size-range there ought to be a size where reproduction occurs. The existential theory predicts the first DNA, and from there we get to the evolutionary theory.
Another predictive quality is that the theory predicts a
dense
Big Bang. The a priori beginning of the universe logically is emptiness because emptiness doesnÂ´t need any prior logical justification for its existence because it doesnÂ´t exist. In emptiness laws of nature are true, such as the laws pointing toward and handleing energymass (like E=mc
2
), and thus the Big Bang begins infinitely dense because E=mc
2
is equally true simultaneously in the smallest of spaces. Tiny empty spaces having E=mc
2
be true in them simultaneously and directly as there was nothingness predicts a dense Big Bang. A region, contained within event horizons made out of energymasses speeding away at >c (due to dark energy causing accelerating cosmic expansion), is by definition â€œnothingâ€ in which E=mc
2
being true in the tiniest spaces summons a dense big bang out of reach of the closest (v = >c) energymass. Nothingness (out of reach for the closest energymasses because they are speeding away at >c) is summoned in the central point with event horizons as the furthest away border, causing Big Bang (due to laws of nature summoning energymass in the empty center).
The theory of evolution begins with the first reproducing shape. It was a shape that assembled surrounding mass into a similar shape. The existential theory predicts the existence of infinitely many such shapes. What inevitable becomes true when you have reproduction is that some die and some survive (life and death), that the number of offspring that shape make matters and that there is mutations over time. This is true about the shapeÂ´s offspring: some will die and some will survive, the number of offspring they make matters and the offspring can be different from the original shape. These three rules / laws of nature were inactive before the first reproduction occurred. The next main event was that one of these shapes found that if it injected its DNA into other shapesÂ´ reproductive mechanism, it exploited principle number two: that the number of offspring matters. It was the first virus: it hijacked othersÂ´ reproduction. The rule / law of nature that came into play with this event was that "power" matters: hijacking othersÂ´ reproductive mechanism gives evolutionary benefits. Now weÂ´ve listed the four main rules that govern evolutionary theory: first came the three first, and then came the forth: power. The next main event - to guard against viruses taking over all life / reproductive mechanisms - was that an immune system evolved to protect against virusÂ´ hijack attempts. This required multicellularism. Just like immune systems prompt/require multicellularism, immune systems prompt/require multigenderedism: to win in the arms race against quickly mutating viruses two genders arose to amplify the mutations to the immune system. Mixing genes from two genders creates a more mutated immune system, which can keep ahead in the arms race against quickly-mutating viruses "trying" to mutate to bypass any immune system. The next main event is that one of these multicellular organisms - a fish or worm - of the male gender mutated to be ag
g
ressive and defeat other males in battle. He wouldÂ´ve gotten access to many more females than his non-ag
g
ressive counter-parts. This too can be called "power" because the ag
g
ressive male hijacks other maleÂ´s access to females by killing the males. This prompts the dinosaurs because larger muscle mass and shaper weaponry is better at killing off competitors. Amongst the dinosaurs there was the mother-offspring bond, placed there by evolution for the evolutionary benefits a mother gets from seeing an offspring survive to adulthood. This bond mutated to involve flock-members because a group working together out-competes any individualists when fighting over anything. The next main event was that someone mapped the flock, in his brain, as a hierarchy (up-down-axis) with the longing to
be the top of the hierarchy. This capitalist striving for
the top made brains grew larger â€“ larger memory-banks, more accurate predictions and faster planning are all advantages coming
from a larger cortex.
Power lead men to accumulate resources â€“ the very resources females needed for their children. Females care most about their children because they pass on their genes, so in finding a male they aim for loyalty plus status/power/placement in the hierarchy. Females think a lot about how others â€“ especially suitors â€“ perceive them and therefore males evolved the subconscious mechanism, to keep womenâ€™sÂ´ attention, to push-pull i.e. to, in one coherent fluent conversation, both say negative feedback about the woman and positive feedback.
It is a major historical event that there finally is an atheistic argument that is sh
aped like a university course: i
t is an existential theory plus evolution which not only doesnÂ´t need a personified god to function, but the pillars (infinite sizerange of energymasspacetime and distinction-anti-distinction-opposition) canÂ´t have a personified god added to them as a 4th pillar without the theory sounding ridicilous. Not only does the theory not need a personified god but adding a god destroys the minimalistic rationally complete beauty of the theory. Gods uglify the theory. The dawn of the theory is a major historical event because never before has an entire course (beginning with certain truth, going through the existential theory and ending in evolution) been laid out in the intellectual debate of atheism, as an argument against a personified god.
The anatomy in the brain from hearing certain truth (I think & I am) - the beginning of the course - creates the same neuronal pathways / associations between ideas in every single person who knows certain truth. The logical step to "distinction" is noting, as a meta-analysis of the primary certain truth, that one has many ideas (I think AND I am) and that one can take logical pathways to the next step in the course (distinction exists). Then juxtaposing anti-distinction with distinction creates the unseeable - "defying reason" (because reason is, in simple people, only visual) - conclusion that we/distinction cannot see reality/anti-distinction. The distinction-anti-distinction-opposition is hard to grasp because it - like formal logic or math - uses words instead of pictures (the linguistic brainhalf rather than the visual one). We evolved to be like "if I see it I believe it" and that was a good heuristic (rule of thumb) because practical sequences of events can be verified as true or untrue by visualizing them. But in this philosophy: no - it has to be linguistic that we deny ourselves the concept "all of reality", leading to the conclusion that there is more to reality than anything - however vaguely the universe has defined "represent" - can represent. This adds infinitely many sizes to our abstract size-range / size-time-diagram; it makes a square (with size on the y-axis and time on the x-axis) with infinity symbols in each corner, which in turn becomes a pillar in our personified-god-denying existential theory.
To come from certain truth, through mere logical steps (meta-analyses and juxtaposition of opposites), to an existential theory which predicts evolution is a major historical event in the history of atheism.
In a historical context the anatomy (neural connections between ideas and sequences of logic) created by this course is like a paradigm-shift into a new era of earth society - an era similar to
that existent on infinitely many other planets who have come further than our midway-mark in a regular water-bearing planetÂ´s history.
Evolution, by beginning with "a mass that can assemble surrounding mass into a similar shape" steps forth from the existential theoryÂ´s infinite size-range of energymasspacetime. Assuming DNA is the replication-molecule, we can step - skipping over how cell walls evolved etc - to the fact that viruses mutate to hijack othersÂ´ reproductive system. This - in this universal inter-planetary extraterrestrial culture - is formulated, in books of logic, as first three rules arising (life/death, number of offspring matters and "there is mutation in each generation-shift") and then a forth rule arising (power, with viruses). This story - which in our course begins from a first reproducing shape and ends with finessing the anatomy of power in men - is visualizable like the caveman story-telling narratives we evolved to hear/see. We can proof-check its validity/possibility by following the narrative visually. The visual nature of evolution is in stark contrast to the purely linguistic/abstract nature of the existential theory.
Speaking o
f "abstract" descriptions i.e. d
escriptions that make it very clear to us that our understanding of the universe is a mere map (a reference) and not reality itself (mind you of PlatoÂ´s or KantÂ´s cave-metaphor and "the thing is not the thing itself" -philosophies)... The size-range of energymasspacetime,
at the size of quantum physics
has us describe photons etc using both the wave-description which focu
s
es on lengths of space (this is the "spacetime description") AND - in wave-particle duality - the energymass description that the energy of a photon is its color. Color (as perceived through the eyes), wave/spacetime-description and particle-energy/energymass-description all are valid descriptors of quantum particles. This ability of ours to describe any mass/phenomenon using both energymass- and spacetime-descriptions runs throughout the entire size-range. You can imagine two lines - one representing energymass and the other representing spacetime - running vertically through the pictures on the size-axis. Adding complexity to this, there is likewise two lines - gravity and electromagnetism - both running through the size-axis, gravity having itÂ´s duality of energymass and spacetime descriptions and electromagnetism too having both, in every level of the size-range, energymass and spacetime descriptions. Gravity is both Newtonian "masses pulling toward masses" (energymassÂ´ focus on mass) and Einsteinian "curvature of spacetime" (spacetimeÂ´s focus on space) - both descriptors are accurate.
We are half-way in a planetÂ´s history â€“ 4.5 billion years have passed and 5 billion remain. The theory you now know is, in other words, in cosmic majority â€“ more planets have it than not (if it takes approximately half of a planetÂ´s history to invent it and if it remains true for the rest of the planetÂ´s history). Most other planets i.e. the majority of extraterrestrials are ideological adherents of the theory. Spread this theory to get approval of the majority even though it lives light-years away. Currently 99.9% of the worldÂ´s population lives in the era of religions â€“ spread this theory to end religious wars and terrorism like 9/11. The world-view (the view/diagrams that explain the world) is the same in the cosmic majority.
IÂ´ve worked 10 years to invent this theory and as alone bearing it itÂ´s my responsibility that it spreads. The future civilization in which everyone has the same world-view thus is dependent on me. I feel a
unique ability to influence earthÂ´s future.
You, as one who has partaken of this rare knowledge, should also feel a responsibility about spreading it to change the world.
IÂ´ve talked about the emotional repertoire in the brain-diagram. If we were to genetically engineer (DNA-manipulate) a next generation, we would A) give it an incredible sense of humor and knowledge so it could entertain us, and/or B) make it a super-happy retard â€“ retarded because positive emotions donÂ´t motivate â€“ they pacify â€“ so super-happy is equal to looking like a mongoloid; needs and wants and everything that drives us is painful â€“ pain motivates while super-happiness pacifies. We would, by creating these DNA-engineered emotional repertoires (to accomplish the dual goal of incredible happiness and incredible entertainers/comedians/philosophers), be doing something that is done on other planets â€“ these are universal engineering goals. I need money to accomplish this project. If you wish to contribute, contact yonis1@gmail.com
You know that gold plate we sent up into space for aliens to find? It had etched on it images of man, some music, some other picturesâ€¦ We didnÂ´t send up the diagram discussed in this book. If the aliens see the gold plate we did send up, theyÂ´ll read between the lines â€“ seeing that there is no universal diagram â€“ and conclude that: â€œon earth they still believe in godsâ€.
You know how most people dedicate a large part of their lives to religion? Once they understand my tattoo (diagram) theyÂ´ll ask themselves: â€œwhat the hell have I been praying to?â€ It resembles a tiny needle popping a big balloon.
If this book goes mainstream, the future becomes so interesting that one forgets oneÂ´s everyday problems.
Interesting important things relieve
anxiety
(especially when they contain humor like a universal tattoo).
Nazis were friends with Nazis, communists were friends with communists, USA was friends with USA, when jihadists meet they share the same ideology and thus bond quickly. My
theory/ideology/religion-replacer is empathy-increasing.
The more things people agree upon the better.
In the diagram/tattoo there are about 16 â€œlinesâ€ (hundreds if we consider the emotional repertoire being drawn the same on other planets). The sport is to draw as many universal lines as possible â€“ drawn from science so they can be drawn from science anywhere in the infinite universe.
God is a war-motivator. They say â€œthere are no atheists in trenchholesâ€. You need a bit of God to do war.
ItÂ´s hard to be an atheist warrior. My book, by disproving god, thus makes motivation for war less.
Gods contribute nothing â€“ one will have the full human experience-repertoire without gods.
Rather no direction than the wrong direction â€“ gods only contribute to war; itÂ´s better to be tolerantly caveman, uncaring of ideologies/world-views, than to be religious.
It seems mean to say that â€œitÂ´s their fault that religious wars keep on going â€“ those that wonÂ´t studyâ€, but itÂ´s good marketing.
Accomplices.
From having read this book, the following should now be understandable:
Certain truth leads to the conclusion â€œdistinctionâ€, and simultaneously warrants an anti-distinction defined as â€œthat of which all is partâ€. The opposition between distinction and anti-distinction â€“ despite â€œrepresentationâ€ being ubiquitous (infinitely vaguely defined) â€“ together with the â€œmax size?â€-question asked in anti-distinction â€“ supports the fact that reality i.e. size-time is infinite. This then becomes our pillar in our existential theory that moves God away from a creator role. The two other pillars are energimasspacetime (found in E=mc
2
) and the opposition that we live in a singular reality yet see multiple things. From the middle of the known size-range (which itself is part of the infinite size-range) comes the tip of a triangle which symbolizes evolution. From evolution, then, comes the brain diagram with dopamine & serotonin across the visual and linguistic brainhalves, and a lower box which is our 3-category emotional repertoire; the most common 4 emotions in our idle society being power-hungryness (how to elevate oneself in the socioeconomic hierarchy if one is a man; and for females itÂ´s mapping the status-hierarchy of men in their social group as to find them differently attractive), expanding oneÂ´s world-view, planning sex and planning resource-gathering/work.
This makes for a multi-symbol diagram involving the existential theoryÂ´s three pillars holding up the square-triangle-brain (size-time-diagram, evolution, brain) diagram.
Certain truth is or leads to distinction, which itself â€“ as all distinct things are â€“ is part of anti-distinction.
This is like saying obvious things about the reality/everyday world in front of us: such as that size is infinite and that it is something in nothing. All this, in turn, leads us to draw a square: a size-time diagram with infinity-symbols in all 4 corners. From the middle of the known size-range,
then, comes a triangle â€“ evolution â€“ which ends up in the brain with serotonine, dopamine, two brainhalves, a cortex and an emotional repertoire (upper- and lower box). In the emotional repertoire there are 4 idle emotions, among them â€œseeking powerâ€ â€“ power here is defined as outcompeting other males (if oneself is male) in a status competition, but the principle of diminishing other malesÂ´ reproductive capabilities happened at several stages in evolution: males fighting males (growing bigger to become dinosaurs) or viruses hijacking reproductive mechanisms of single-celled organisms.
The search for power thus has led to brain-size growing (when competing for upwardness in hierarchies) but also things like T-rexÂ´s claws or the 1918 flu â€“ not to mention war.
Previous atheists have moved God from a place where do intervenes in everyday life using miracles, to a God that set everything in motion but then doesnÂ´t intervene. My philosophy places God as a bum who watches a skyscraper get built â€“ the bum then gets praised for the skyscraper getting built even though the bum didnÂ´t contribute anything: at most he watched as other mechanisms got everything done. Or God is a football fan who cheers at the players but doesnÂ´t himself contribute to making goals. Natural mechanisms create the world â€“ no need to praise God.
This book is worth you reading if it solves (or significantly helps) a major problem.
It is good marketing of my book to outline
the problem that I solve here.
USA is better than war, right? USA has poor folks committing crime â€“ thatÂ´s far better than nations waring. I move the problem from a macro-scale where nations fight eachother over oil, to an individualistic/family-based/friendship-based micro-scale where everyone feels as ideological/religious comrades â€“ empathy and friendship-buildingly sharing the knowledge of this book. I can get everyone to have the same ideology/religion-replacement so that thereÂ´ll be no war over the oil that has made us rich enough to not witness babies dying every day. Nations, races, ideologies, religions â€“ large groups â€“ makes the difference between war and crime. I solve the problems of macro-war and the friendship problem once everyone knows my diagrams. The post-oil decline isnÂ´t going to be pretty but we can take all measures to alleviate it â€“ spread this book.
If God is defined as â€œthe reason for existenceâ€ and I present a complete existential theory as a diagram, and I tattoo the diagram on my arm, is my arm then God? No, just a symbol for the reason for existence. One can tattoo an explanatory model for existence and God has during thousands of years been defined as the cause for existence.

Texten bÃ¶rjar med sÃ¤ker sanning, sedan gÃ¥r den till att fÃ¶rklara varfÃ¶r nÃ¥gonting existerar istÃ¤llet fÃ¶r ingenting (den existentiella teorin â€“ varfÃ¶r vi existerar), sedan gÃ¥r den till evolutionÃ¤r teori vilket fÃ¶rutsÃ¤gs av den existentiella teorin. Den evolutionÃ¤ra teorin fÃ¶rklarar vardagsfenomen.
Du vet med sÃ¤kerhet att du tÃ¤nker och att du existerar eftersom om du skulle bliva lurad av en allsmÃ¤ktig demon som fÃ¶rsÃ¶ker lura dig i allt du kan bli lurad i, sÃ¥ Ã¤r lurendrejeriet i sig en tanke-process och dÃ¤rfÃ¶r vet du att tankar existerar (du tÃ¤nker). FÃ¶r att du ska bli lurad sÃ¥ mÃ¥ste du existera och dÃ¤rfÃ¶r vet du â€jag existerarâ€. Att bli lurad Ã¤r en tankeprocess och tÃ¤nkaren Ã¤r nÃ¶dvÃ¤ndig fÃ¶r att det ska finnas nÃ¥gon som blir lurad. SÃ¥ du vet: oavsett vad sÃ¥ tÃ¤nker du och existerar du. Ã…vanstÃ¥ende Ã¤r tvÃ¥ saker, eller hur? De Ã¤r bÃ¥da del av samma hjÃ¤rna och samma tankeprocess kan bli ens analytiska verktygssats/tÃ¤nkare, men vi erkÃ¤nner Ã¤ndÃ¥ att det finns distinkta entiteter â€“ att det finns distinktion. Detta kan ocksÃ¥ kallas separation. Vad Ã¤r distinktions motsats, anti-distinktion? Det Ã¤r en verklighet; det som allt Ã¤r del av; den Ã¤r en och dess definition i ordboken Ã¤r att allt Ã¤r del av den. Om vi skriver distinktion (tÃ¤nkare och tanke) pÃ¥ vÃ¤nster sida av ett papper och anti-distinktion (verkligheten; det som allt Ã¤r del av; en) pÃ¥ hÃ¶ger sida av pappret â€“ kan den vÃ¤nstra sidan se den hÃ¶gra sidan? Nej, fÃ¶r att oppositionen mellan distinktion och anti-distinktion. Det finns alltid en observerare (tÃ¤nkaren) och dÃ¤rmed distinktion i varje observation och dÃ¤rmed kan anti-distinktion ej representeras/ses.
HjÃ¤rnan evolverade fÃ¶r att hantera naturliga fenomen â€“ det fanns aldrig ett scenario i historien dÃ¥ nÃ¥gonting osynligt behÃ¶vde hanteras och betÃ¤nkas. DÃ¤rfÃ¶r antar vi att tanke-processen blev fel nÃ¤r vi sÃ¤ger att distinktion/vi inte kan se anti-distinktion/verkligheten. Men tankeprocessen gick inte fel: allt det betyder Ã¤r att det finns mer till verkligheten Ã¤n kan representeras. Oavsett hur vagt â€representerasâ€ Ã¤r definierat, lÃ¥t oss sÃ¤ga att en kaffekopp â€“ oavsett om hjÃ¤rnor Ã¤r involverade eller inte â€“ antas fÃ¶rsÃ¶ka representera det som allt Ã¤r del av, dÃ¥ gÃ¶r anti-distinktions-distinktions-oppositionen (motsÃ¤ttningen mellan distinktion och dess motsats) att representationen Ã¤r inkorrekt. Vi kan frÃ¥ga om en anti-distinkt â€sakâ€ har en maximumstorlek och dÃ¤rmed distinktion? Nej. PÃ¥ samma not Ã¤r ett annat bevis fÃ¶r att storleksskalan Ã¤r oÃ¤ndlig Ã¤r att vi ser nÃ¥gonting (vÃ¥r vardagsvÃ¤rld) samt kan gÃ¶ra hypoteser ad infinitum, och Ã¤ndÃ¥ representerar ingenting ALL verklighet. Verkligheten dvs storlek-tid Ã¤r dÃ¤rfÃ¶r oÃ¤ndligt.
En oÃ¤ndlig storleksskala Ã¤r en av pelarna i den existentiella teorin. En annan pelare Ã¤r att energimassa och rumtid Ã¤r motsatser (opposition) men sammanflÃ¤tade sÃ¥som i E=mc
2
(dÃ¤r c
2
hÃ¤nvisar till en hastighet dvs rum Ã¶ver tid: rumtid). Multiplikationen sammanfÃ¶r energimassa tillsammans med rumtid; ingenting tillsammans med nÃ¥gonting/allting; existens tillsammans med icke-existens. VarfÃ¶r finns det existens i form av min kropp? Utan att gÃ¥ in i det historiska svaret sÃ¥ kan man fÃ¶rklara det genom att sÃ¤ga att kroppen Ã¤r nÃ¥gonting i (sammanflÃ¤tat med) ingenting, av en storlek i en oÃ¤ndlig storleks-skala (dÃ¤r relationen mellan vilka tvÃ¥ storlekar som helst (eller objekt av tvÃ¥ storlekar) Ã¤r att de Ã¤r fÃ¶rklaringen till varandra dvs rÃ¤ttfÃ¤rdigar varandra. Sedan finns det ocksÃ¥, som tredje pelare, distinktions-anti-distinktions-opposition dvs vi lever i en singular (ej plural) verklighet men ser distinkta/separata entiteter sÃ¥som tÃ¤nkare och tanke.
PÃ¥ tal om rumtid, rumtid Ã¤r den logiska startpunkten fÃ¶r den tidsbaserade existentiella teorin. Ingenting (tom rumtid) behÃ¶ver inget inledande/tidigare rÃ¤ttfÃ¤rdigande eller anledning att existera, fÃ¶r att det existerar inte. I den, hursomhelst, Ã¤r naturlagarna sanna dvs den Ã¤r inte irrationell / anti-logisk, och bland naturlagarna finns de som, inklusive E=mc
2
, som nÃ¤mner energimassa. Skulle energimassa kunna â€nÃ¤mnasâ€ utan att det skulle existera? Om â€jaâ€ sÃ¥ skulle det vara absurt / anti-logiskt. VarfÃ¶r skulle verkligheten nÃ¤mna saker som aldrig existerar? Eftersom naturlagarna Ã¤r strikta och tack vare vÃ¥r regel â€det som nÃ¤mns mÃ¥ste existera eller uppstÃ¥â€ sÃ¥ fÃ¥r vi, varÃ¤n (i de minsta storlekarna) dÃ¤r E=mc
2
nÃ¤mns, sÃ¥ finns existens och dÃ¤rfÃ¶r en tÃ¤t big bang. Faktumet att galaxer rusar ivÃ¤g accelererandes frÃ¥n varandra leder till ingenting (tom rymd) i framtiden, och med mellanhanden â€naturlagarâ€ sÃ¥ uppstÃ¥r energimassa igen sÃ¥ tÃ¤t som den kan vara. Ingen tids-delay mellan ingenting â€“ naturlagar â€“ energimassa men sÃ¥ snart en begrÃ¤nsad (av event-horizons som bestÃ¤ms av ljuset Ã¤ndliga hastighet) region blir ingenting/tomrum, sÃ¥ uppstÃ¥r en big bang som sedan genom kosmisk expansion blir ingenting igen, som sedan blir tomrum och en ny big bang igen. Detta Ã¤r den tidsmÃ¤ssiga beskrivningen om varfÃ¶r energimassa (som existerar sammanflÃ¤tad med rumtid sÃ¥som i E=mc
2
) bÃ¶rjar tÃ¤t och blir ingenting, och sedan repetitation.
Det Ã¥vanstÃ¥ende Ã¤r en rivalteori till â€Gud skapade jorden pÃ¥ 6 dagar och vilade pÃ¥ den sjundeâ€. Den Ã¤r inte intuitiv eftersom den har att gÃ¶ra med saker som vi inte hade att gÃ¶ra med under evolutionen: osynliga energimassarumtid/verkligheten/anti-distinktion som del av vÃ¥rt resonemang. Den har ocksÃ¥ en multi-anledning orsak fÃ¶r vÃ¥r existens: en tidsvis rationale involverandes bÃ¶rjan och slutet pÃ¥ big bang, kombinerad med en 3-pelares existentiell teori som rÃ¤ttfÃ¤rdigar storlek och energimassa. Den Ã¤r abstrakt/vetenskaplig men kan inte reduceras till simplare termer. Det Ã¤r den minsta gemensamma nÃ¤mnaren som alla kan tro pÃ¥ (oavsett religion).
Hur vagt har verkligheten definerat â€att representeraâ€?
OÃ¤ndligt vagt â€“ vad som helst kan representera vad som helst.
Ã„r representationen/representÃ¶ren verkligheten eller Allah?
Nej.
Kan nÃ¥gonting representera det som allt Ã¤r del av?
Nej.
DÃ¥ Ã¤r storleks-tids-diagrammet oÃ¤ndligt dvs inget representerar verkligheten. Hur mÃ¥nga Ã¤r den? Hur mÃ¥nga Ã¤r Allah? 1.
Sa denâ€¦, eller skrev den en bok?
Detta motbevisar att Allah skrev en bok.
Igen: hur mycket av verkligheten kan representeras av, sÃ¤g, en mÃ¥lning? All den?
Nej, hela verkligheten kan ej representeras. Precis som Allah inte kan fÃ¥ngas i ett ord/en bild.
Vi kan ha hypoteser â€“ hur mÃ¥nga hypoteser kan vi ha?
Om verkligheten Ã¤r storlekar och tider, energimassa och rumtid sÃ¥ Ã¤r det rektangulÃ¤ra storleks-tids-diagrammet med energimassarumtid i varje koordinat det universella sÃ¤ttet att representera allt som finns att representera.
Skriver den bÃ¶cker? Nej, den Ã¤r inte av fÃ¶rfattarnatur.
â€Gud sa till Muhammed ord fÃ¶r ordâ€¦â€ Ã¤r alltsÃ¥ ett falskt eller som mest ett metaforiskt pÃ¥stÃ¥ende.
â€Du mÃ¥ste gÃ¶ra ritualer fÃ¶r att inte hamna i helvetet, och i himmelen fÃ¥r du 72 oskulderâ€ Ã¤r med samma logik ocksÃ¥ ett falskt pÃ¥stÃ¥ende.
Det finns tre alternativ som fundament fÃ¶r denna logik â€“ kan du tÃ¤nka ut ett fjÃ¤rde?
1: Verkligheten Ã¤r ett synonym fÃ¶r Allah,
2: eller sÃ¥ finns inte Allah
3: eller sÃ¥ finns 72 oskulder (ej ett alternativ eftersom verkligheten inte Ã¤r av den naturen, dÃ¥ den Ã¤r storleks-tids-energimassarumtid, att den skriver bÃ¶cker).
Som tillÃ¤gg till det rektangulÃ¤ra storleks-tids-diagrammet med oÃ¤ndlighetssymboler i varje hÃ¶rn, och den evolutionÃ¤ra triangeln som representerar att livet blev mer komplext ju mer tiden gick (triangelns spets har sitt ursprung i mittersta storleken i den kÃ¤nda storleksskalan), finns fÃ¶ljande hjÃ¤rn-diagram:
Den existentiella teorin med dess tre pelare, dvs en oÃ¤ndlig storleksskala, energimassarumtid och distinktions-anti-distinktions-opposition, fÃ¶rutsÃ¤ger att det borde finnas en liten bit DNA som kopierar sig.
Evolutionsteorin bÃ¶rjar med den fÃ¶rsta reproducerande formen. Det var en form som samlande kringliggande massa till en liknande form. Den existentiella teorin fÃ¶rutsÃ¤ger existensen av oÃ¤ndligt mÃ¥nga sÃ¥dana former. Det som oundvikligen blir sant nÃ¤r man har reproduktion Ã¤r att vissa dÃ¶r medan andra Ã¶verlever (liv och dÃ¶d), att antalet avkomma/kopior formen gÃ¶r har betydelse och att det finns mutationer Ã¶ver tid. FÃ¶ljande Ã¤r sant om formens avkomma: vissa dÃ¶r medan andra Ã¶verlever, antalet avkomma har betydelse och avkomman Ã¤r annorlunda frÃ¥n originalformen. Dessa tre regler / naturlagar var inaktiva innan den fÃ¶rsta reproduktionen skedde. NÃ¤sta stora steg var nÃ¤r ett av dessa former mÃ¶jliggjorde fÃ¶r sig sjÃ¤lv att injicera sitt DNA in i andra formers reproduktiva mekanism, vilket utnyttjade princip nr 2: att antalet avkomma har betydelse. Det var det fÃ¶rsta viruset: den hijackade andras reproduktion. Regeln / naturlagen som kom i spel i.om. denna hÃ¤ndelse var att â€maktâ€ har betydelse: att hijacka andras reproduktiva mekanism ger evolutionÃ¤ra fÃ¶rdelar. Nu har vi lagt fram de fyra huvudregelerna som Ã¤r evolutionsteori: fÃ¶rst kom de tre fÃ¶rsta reglerna, sedan kom den fjÃ¤rde: makt. NÃ¤sta stora hÃ¤ndelse â€“ fÃ¶r att skydda mot att virus hijackar alla reproduktiva system â€“ var att ett immunsystem evolverade fÃ¶r att skydda mot virus hijacks-fÃ¶rsÃ¶k. Detta behÃ¶vde multicellulÃ¤rism. Precis som immunsystem krÃ¤ver multicellularism, sÃ¥ behÃ¶ver immunsystem multikÃ¶nadhet: fÃ¶r att vinna i kampen dÃ¤r virus muterar fÃ¶r att kringgÃ¥ immunsystem sÃ¥ behÃ¶ver immunsystemet ocksÃ¥ maximalt med mutation. Att mixa gener frÃ¥n tvÃ¥ kÃ¶n skapar ett mer muterat immunsystem, vilket hÃ¥ller ut i kampen mot virus dÃ¤r virus â€fÃ¶rsÃ¶kerâ€ mutera sig runt immunsystemet. Den nÃ¤sta stora hÃ¤ndelsen var att en av dessa multicellulÃ¤ra organismer â€“ en fisk eller mask â€“ av det manliga kÃ¶net muterade till att vara agressiv och fÃ¶rinta andra manliga varelser. Han skulle ha fÃ¥tt hÃ¶gre tillgÃ¥ng till kvinnliga organismer jÃ¤mfÃ¶rt med hans icke-agressiva likar. Detta kan ocksÃ¥ kallas â€maktâ€ eftersom agressiva hanar hijackar andra hanars tillgÃ¥ng till kvinnor genom att dÃ¶da hanarna. Detta orsakar dinosaurierna eftersom stÃ¶rre muskelmassa och skarpare vapen Ã¤r bÃ¤ttre pÃ¥ att dÃ¶da rivalerna. Bland dinosaurierna fanns moder-avkomma-bandet, ditplacerad av evolutionen eftersom det var en fÃ¶rdel fÃ¶r mÃ¶drar att se sina barn Ã¶verleva till vuxenskap. Detta band muterade till att involvera flock-medlemmar eftersom en grupp sammarbetandes bÃ¤ttre kan vinna Ã¶ver individualister i brÃ¥k om vad som helst. NÃ¤sta stora steg var att nÃ¥gon kartlade flocken, i sin hjÃ¤rna, som en hierarki (upp-ned-axeln) med en lÃ¤ngtan efter att stÃ¥ hÃ¶gst upp i hierarkin. Denna kapitalistiska tÃ¤vlan mot toppen gjorde att hjÃ¤rnan vÃ¤xte sig stÃ¶rre â€“ stÃ¶rre minnesbank, mer detaljrika fÃ¶rutsÃ¤gelser och snabbare planering Ã¤r alla fÃ¶rdelar som kommer frÃ¥n att ha ett stÃ¶rre kortex.
Du har en komposit-sÃ¤ker sanning bestÃ¥endes av tvÃ¥ sÃ¤kra sanningar: du kan med sÃ¤kerhet sÃ¤ga att du tÃ¤nker (fÃ¶r att om du skulle bli lurad: att bli lurad Ã¤r en tankeprocess) och att du existerar (eftersom att bli lurad krÃ¤ver den som blir lurad). Jag tÃ¤nker och jag finns Ã¤r ett pÃ¥stÃ¥ende men tvÃ¥ sanningar. Du kan med sÃ¤kerhet pÃ¥stÃ¥ dig ha â€distinktionâ€ eftersom du har att gÃ¶ra med multipla separata entiteter (sÃ¥som â€jagâ€ och â€tankarâ€). Man kan sÃ¤ga, nÃ¤r man ser den sÃ¤kra sanningens â€jag tÃ¤nkerâ€ och â€jag existerarâ€, att avstÃ¥endet/mellanrummet mellan de tvÃ¥ idÃ©erna (tÃ¤nkare och tanke) Ã¤r distinktion. AvstÃ¥endet/mellanrummet som separarar tÃ¤nkare frÃ¥n tanke Ã¤r nÃ¶dvÃ¤ndigt fÃ¶r â€disktinktionâ€ att hÃ¤rledas som sÃ¤ker sanning fÃ¶ljandes ur nÃ¤sta logiska steg, med ursprunget av den originella primÃ¤ra sÃ¤kra sanningen.
Ã„r alla distinkta entiteter del av en singulÃ¤r verklighet om â€verklighetenâ€ Ã¤r definierad som â€det som allt Ã¤r del avâ€? Med andra ord: om vi ritar distinktion pÃ¥ vÃ¤nster sida av ett papper och anti-distinktion (distinktionÂ´s motsats: en ensam verklighet â€“ det som allt Ã¤r del av. Zoomandes ut maximalt) pÃ¥ hÃ¶ger sida av pappret, kan dÃ¥ distinktion representera hÃ¶ger sida av pappret dvs anti-distinktion? Hur skulle nÃ¥gon distinkt entitet kunna vara/representera motsatsen till vad representation/distinktion Ã¤r? Vilken representation som helst av anti-distinktion/verkligheten mÃ¥ste ha minst tre entiteter: tÃ¤nkare, mellanrummet mellan tÃ¤nkare och tanke, och tanke.
Separation/distinktion Ã¤r antaget i representation, vilket innebÃ¤r att anti-distinktion Ã¤r orepreserbart.
Hur vagt har universum/Gud definerat vad en representation Ã¤r dvs nÃ¤r en representation sker? VÃ¥ra hjÃ¤rnor anvÃ¤nder neuroner fÃ¶r att representera, men vad sÃ¤gs om â€“ istÃ¤llet fÃ¶r neuroner (oavsett om hjÃ¤rnor Ã¤r inblandade eller inte) â€“ universum lÃ¥ter vilket slumpmÃ¤ssigt valt objekt som helst lÃ¥ta sig sÃ¤gas, sÃ¥som neuroner sÃ¤gs, representera verkligheten? Universum har definierat â€representationâ€ oÃ¤ndligt vagt dvs uteslutandes hjÃ¤rnor sÃ¥ kan vilket slumpmÃ¤ssigt objekt som helst spotant bli/vara symbolen fÃ¶r all verklighet â€“ fÃ¶r att universum har definierat â€representeraâ€ oÃ¤ndligt vagt. Trots den oÃ¤ndligt vaga definitionen av vad som representerar vad, sÃ¥ gÃ¶r distinktions-anti-distinktions-oppositionen (linjen som separerar vÃ¤nster sida av pappret frÃ¥n hÃ¶ger sida; motsÃ¤ttningen mellan distinktion och anti-distinktion) att verkligheten Ã¤r orepresenterbar. Om verkligheten Ã¤r anti-distinktion dÃ¥ finns ingen distinktion (representation Ã¤r oundvikligen distinktion), trots universums oÃ¤ndligt vaga definition av â€representeraâ€, fÃ¥nga verkligheten. I representationer kan vi rÃ¤kna minst tre saker och det vi fÃ¶rsÃ¶ker representera Ã¤r en sak utan nÃ¥gonting utanfÃ¶r den. Faktumet att representationer innehÃ¥ller distinktion gÃ¶r att att fÃ¥nga verkligheten (allt som ett) omÃ¶jligt.
Vi kan ha oÃ¤ndligt mÃ¥nga eller oÃ¤ndligt innehÃ¥llsfulla/stora representationer/hypoteser â€“ sÃ¥som ett oÃ¤ndligt storleks-tids-diagram â€“ och genom att abstrakt peka till verkligheten, sÃ¥ gÃ¶r universums regel att ingenting representerar verkligheten trots universums oÃ¤ndligt vaga definition av â€representeraâ€ av oÃ¤ndligt mycket, gÃ¶r verkligheten orepresenterbar. Detta kan bara betyda en sak: verkligheten â€“ som vi kÃ¤nner som storlekar och tider (ett storleks-tids-diagram) â€“ Ã¤r oÃ¤ndligt. Det finns oÃ¤ndligt stort och oÃ¤ndligt litet med oÃ¤ndligt mycket dÃ¥tid och oÃ¤ndligt mycket framtid. Detta rektangulÃ¤ra storleks-tids-diagram dvs vÃ¥r vardagsvÃ¤rld av storlek-tid har oÃ¤ndligheter Ã¶verallt.
Energimassa i rumtid: ett i noll, existens i icke-existens, nÃ¥gonting i ingenting â€“ sÃ¥som definierats av E=mc
2
dÃ¤r c
2
stÃ¥r fÃ¶r ljusets hastighet (rum Ã¶ver tid dvs rumtid/noll/icke-existens) och E=m refererar till energimassa (existens, nÃ¥gonting, allt).
Distinktions-anti-distinktions-opposition: vi lever i en singulÃ¤r verklighet men vi ser multipla objekt.
En oÃ¤ndlig storleksskala.
De Ã¥vanstÃ¥ende tre idÃ©erna Ã¤r en existentiell teori (en teori som fÃ¶rklarar existensen av en reproduktiv form dvs evolutions bÃ¶rjan dvs vÃ¥r existens). Det Ã¤r modernt att anvÃ¤nda sig av tre likvÃ¤rdiga idÃ©er fÃ¶r att fÃ¶rklara ens existens â€“ alla tidigare existentiella teorier har antingen anvÃ¤nt en enda idÃ© (monoteism) eller en saga/myt (mÃ¥nga vardagliga (ej vetenskapliga/abstrakta) idÃ©er) fÃ¶r att fÃ¶rklara existens.
Den fÃ¶rutsÃ¤gande kvalitÃ©n som gÃ¶r denna existentiella teori till en vetenskaplig teori Ã¤r att den, baserat pÃ¥ en oÃ¤ndlig storleksskala av energimassarumtid och distinktions-anti-distinktions-opposition, fÃ¶rutsÃ¤ger att det i en oÃ¤ndlig storleksskala borde finnas en storlek dÃ¤r reproduktion (DNA) sker. Den existentiella teorin fÃ¶rutsÃ¤ger det fÃ¶rsta DNA:t, och frÃ¥n det fÃ¥r vi evolutionÃ¤r teori.
En annan fÃ¶rutsÃ¤gande kvalitÃ© Ã¤r att teorin fÃ¶rutsÃ¤ger att big bang borde varit
tÃ¤t
. A-priori begynnelsen av universum Ã¤r logiskt sett tomhet eftersom tomhet inte behÃ¶ver nÃ¥gon tidigare/fÃ¶religgande logiskt rÃ¤ttfÃ¤rdigande eftersom det ej existerar. I tom rumtid Ã¤r naturlagarna sanna, sÃ¥som naturlagarna som hanterar energimassa (sÃ¥som E=mc
2
), och dÃ¤rfÃ¶r bÃ¶rjar big bang oÃ¤ndligt tÃ¤t â€“ fÃ¶r att E=mc
2
Ã¤r lika sann samtidigt i de minsta storlekarna. De minsta tomma rymderna hade E=mc
2
som sann inom sig direkt nÃ¤r det fanns ingenting, vilket fÃ¶rutsÃ¤ger en tÃ¤t big bang. En region, inom event horizons gjorda av energimassa rusandes ivÃ¤g i >c (pga mÃ¶rk energi accelererandes kosmisk expansion) Ã¤r per definition â€ingentingâ€ i vilket E=mc
2
Ã¤r sann i de minsta utrymmena, vilket Ã¥stadkommer en big bang utom rÃ¤ckhÃ¥ll fÃ¶r de nÃ¤rmaste ( v = >c) energimassa. Ingenting (utom rÃ¤ckhÃ¥ll fÃ¶r nÃ¤rmaste energimassa fÃ¶r att den Ã¤r pÃ¥ vÃ¤g bortÃ¥t i >c) orsakas i centrumpunkten som har event horizons som grÃ¤ns lÃ¤ngst bort, vilket leder till en big bang (eftersom naturlagarna uppbringar energimassa i det tomma centrumet).
Det Ã¤r en stor historisk hÃ¤ndelse att det Ã¤ntligen finns ett ateistiskt argument i form av en universitetskurs: det Ã¤r en existentiell teori plus evolution som inte behÃ¶ver en personifierad gud fÃ¶r att fungera, utan dess pelare (oÃ¤ndlig storleksskala av energimassarumtid och distinktions-anti-distinktions-opposition) kan inte ha en personifierad gud tillagd till dem som en fjÃ¤rde pelare utan att teorin lÃ¥ter lÃ¶jlig. Det Ã¤r inte bara sÃ¥ att teorin inte behÃ¶ver en personifierad gud, utan att lÃ¤gga till en gud fÃ¶rstÃ¶r teorins minimalistiska rationellt kompletta skÃ¶nhet. Gudar fÃ¶rfular teorin. Teorins upptÃ¤ckt Ã¤r en stor historisk hÃ¤ndelse eftersom aldrig fÃ¶rr har en hel kurs (bÃ¶rjandes med sÃ¤ker sanning, gÃ¥endes genom den existentiella teorin och slutandes i evolution) lagts fram i ateismens intellektuella debatt, som ett argument mot en personifierad gud.
Anatomin i hjÃ¤rnan frÃ¥n att hÃ¶ra sÃ¤ker sanning (jag tÃ¤nker & jag finns) â€“ bÃ¶rjan av denna kurs â€“ skapar samma neuronala pathways / associationer mellan idÃ©er i varje person som hÃ¶r vet sÃ¤ker sanning. Det logiska steget till â€distinktionâ€ Ã¤r att notera, som meta-analys av den primÃ¤ra sÃ¤kra sanningen â€“ att man har mÃ¥nga idÃ©er (jag tÃ¤nker OCH jag finns) och att man kan ta den logiska vÃ¤gen till nÃ¤sta steg i kursen (distinktion finns). Att sedan motsÃ¤tta anti-distinktion med distinktion skapar den ofÃ¶rnimmbara â€“ â€mot resonâ€ (eftersom logik Ã¤r, i simpla mÃ¤nniskor, enbart visuell) â€“ slutsatsen att vi/distinktion inte kan se verkligheten/anti-distinktion. Distinktions-anti-distinktions-oppositionen Ã¤r svÃ¥rbegriplig fÃ¶r att den â€“ sÃ¥som formell logik eller matematik â€“ enbart anvÃ¤nder ord istÃ¤llet fÃ¶r bilder (den lingvistiska hjÃ¤rnhalvan istÃ¤llet fÃ¶r den visuella). Vi evolverade till att sÃ¤ga â€om jag kan se det sÃ¥ tror jag pÃ¥ detâ€ och det Ã¤r en god tumregel eftersom praktiska sekvenser hÃ¤ndelser kan verifieras som sanna eller osanna genom att visualisera dem. Men i denna filosofi: nej â€“ det mÃ¥ste vara lingvistiskt att vi fÃ¶rnekar oss sjÃ¤lva konceptet â€all verklighetâ€, vilket leder till slutsatsen att det finns mer till verkligheten Ã¤n nÃ¥gonting â€“ oavsett hur vagt universum definerat â€att representeraâ€ â€“ representerar. Detta tillÃ¤gger oÃ¤ndligt mÃ¥nga storlekar till vÃ¥r abstrakta stoorleksskala / storleks-tids-diagrammet; det gÃ¶r en rektangel (med storlek pÃ¥ y-axeln och tid pÃ¥ x-axeln) med oÃ¤ndlighetstecken i varje hÃ¶rn, som i sin tur blir en pelare i vÃ¥r personlig-gud-fÃ¶rnekande existentiella teori.
Att komma frÃ¥n sÃ¤ker sanningen genom enbart logiska steg (meta-analyser och motsÃ¤ttningsskapande av motsatser) till en existentiell teori som fÃ¶rutsÃ¤er evolutionen Ã¤r en stor historisk hÃ¤ndelse i ateismens historia.
I ett historiskt sammanhang Ã¤r anatomin (neurala anslutningar mellan idÃ©er och sekvenser logik) som skapas av denna kurs som ett paradigm-shifte in i en ny era av civilisation â€“ en era liknande den som finns pÃ¥ oÃ¤ndligt mÃ¥nga planeter vars vetenskap kommit lÃ¤ngre Ã¤n vÃ¥ra 4.5 miljarder Ã¥rs mittenpunkt i en vanlig vattenbÃ¤rande planets historia.
Evolution, genom att bÃ¶rja frÃ¥n â€en massa som samlar kringliggande massa till en liknande formâ€ kliver fram frÃ¥n den existentiella teorins oÃ¤ndliga storleksskala av energimassarumtid. Om vi antar att DNA Ã¤r replikationsmolekylen sÃ¥ kan vi ta steget till â€“ klivandes Ã¶ver hur cellvÃ¤ggar evolverade osv â€“ till att virus hijackar andras reproduktiva system. Detta â€“ i den universella inter-planetÃ¤ra rymdvarelsekulturen â€“ formuleras som, i bÃ¶cker av logik, som att de tre fÃ¶rsta reglerna uppkommer (liv/dÃ¶d, antalet avkomma har betydelse och â€det sker mutationer i varje generationsskifteâ€) och sedan att en fjÃ¤rde regel uppkommer (makt, med virus). Denna historia â€“ som i vÃ¥r kurs bÃ¶rjar frÃ¥n den fÃ¶rsta reproduktiva formen och slutar i att finslipa anatomin bakom makt i mÃ¤n â€“ Ã¤r visualiseringsbar som en grottmanna-historias narrativ likt dem vi evolverade till att se/hÃ¶ra. Vi kan proof-checka/validera historian genom att se den visuellt. Evolutions visuella natur Ã¤r i stark kontrast till den rent linguistiska/abstraka natur som den existentiella teorin har.
PÃ¥ tal om â€abstraktaâ€ beskrivningar dvs beskrivningar som gÃ¶r det vÃ¤ldigt klart fÃ¶r oss att vÃ¥r fÃ¶rstÃ¥else av universum bara Ã¤r en karta (en referens) och inte verkligheten i sig (tÃ¤nk pÃ¥ PlatoÂ´s och KantÂ´s grottmetafor och â€saken Ã¤r inte saken sjÃ¤lvâ€-filosofierâ€)â€¦ Storleksskalan av energimassarumtid, i storleken av kvantfysik har oss beskrivandes fotoner etc anvÃ¤ndandes bÃ¥de vÃ¥g-beskrivningar med fokus pÃ¥ lÃ¤ngder i rymd (dessa Ã¤r â€rumtids-beskrivningarâ€) OCH â€“ i vÃ¥r-partikel-dualitet â€“ energimassabeskrivningen dvs att energin i en foton Ã¤r dess fÃ¤rg. FÃ¤rg (sÃ¥som den uppfattas genom Ã¶gonen), vÃ¥g/rumtids-beskrivningen och partikel-energi/energimassa-beskrivningen Ã¤r alla legitimea beskrivningar av kvantfysiken. VÃ¥r fÃ¶rmÃ¥ga att beskriva vilken massa/vilket fenomen som helst med bÃ¥de energimassa- och rumtids-beskrivningar lÃ¶per genom hela storleksskalan. Du kan fÃ¶restÃ¤lla dig tvÃ¥ linjer â€“ en fÃ¶r energimassa och en fÃ¶r rumtid â€“ gÃ¥endes vertikalt genom alla bilder pÃ¥ storleks-axeln. TillÃ¤ggandes komplexitet pÃ¥ detta finns det tvÃ¥ linjer till â€“ tyngdlagen och elektromagnetism â€“ bÃ¥da gÃ¥endes lÃ¤ngs storleks-axeln, tyngdlagen har dess dualitet av energimassa- och rumtids-beskrivningar och elektromagnetism likasÃ¥ har desamma, dvs energimassa och rumtidsbeskrivningar. Tyngdlagen Ã¤r bÃ¥de Newtonisk â€massor dras till massorâ€ (energimassas fokus pÃ¥ massa) och Einsteinsk â€rumtids krÃ¶kningâ€ (rumtids fokus pÃ¥ rum) â€“ bÃ¥da beskrivningar Ã¤r korrekta.
Vi Ã¤r halvvÃ¤gs igenom en planets historia â€“ 4.5 miljarder Ã¥r har gÃ¥tt och 5 miljarder Ã¥terstÃ¥r. Teorin som du nu vet Ã¤r m.a.o. i kosmisk majoritet â€“ fler planeter har den Ã¤n har den inte (om det tar ungefÃ¤r hÃ¤lften av planetens historia att uppfinna den och om den kvarstÃ¥r under andra hÃ¤lften av planetens historia). De flesta andra planeter dvs majoriteten av rymdvarelser Ã¤r m.a.o. ideologiska anhÃ¤ngare av teorin. Sprid denna teori fÃ¶r att fÃ¥ bekrÃ¤ftelse av majoriteten trots att den bor ljusÃ¥r bort. Just nu lever 99.9% av jordens befolkning i eran av religioner â€“ sprid denna teori fÃ¶r att fÃ¥ slut pÃ¥ religiÃ¶sa krig samt terrorism sÃ¥som 9/11. VÃ¤rldsbilden (bilden/diagrammet som fÃ¶rklarar vÃ¤rlden) Ã¤r densamma i den kosmiska majoriteten.
Jag har jobbat i 10 Ã¥r fÃ¶r att Ã¥stadkomma teorin och som ensam om att kÃ¤nna till den Ã¤r det mitt ansvar att den sprids. Den framtida civilizationen i vilken alla har samma vÃ¤rldsbild hÃ¤nger dÃ¤rfÃ¶r pÃ¥ mig. Jag kÃ¤nner en unik mÃ¶jlighet att pÃ¥verka jordens framtid.

Can we
timetravel? We can proceed from era to era, just like dinosaurs preceded man and not vice versa â€“ its a universal sequence on any planet.
Heaven/karma instinctual but collides with main picture.
Water, primordial soup, proteins, dns strand. Single cell reproducing multiplying. Then 1 of these cells thought â€œill inject my own dna into some other cellâ€, hijack its reproductive system. Very beneficial. So first there were 3 rules: life n death, number of offspring matters and mutation in each generationshift, then with viruses came the 4th rule â€œpowerâ€ â€“ hijacking othersâ€™ reproductive system. Then theres an arms race between viruses and â€¦ â€œOur kind ofâ€ organism, so to mutate our immune system faster two genders arose. Then fights between males led to the dinosaurs. Then brains bonded into groups to fight individualists. Then capitalist power struggles within the group made the brain grow larger, weâ€™re good at planning and remembering things. Then we get to kingdoms. From the water puddle to the 21 st century. Those who proceed to the next era will live in a world where holy book-group bonds are weak and a universal courses group bond is the strongest, thus national wars or civilizational wars where identity is based on other than this science will be impossible. The planet has two future ways to go 60 years from now and one is better but needs some investment of time until everybody knows this course.
Theres a universal course/book thats on every advanced enough planet throughout the universe and at the regeneration of every universe. If you consider the entire corpus of human knowledge, youd find 3 rational starting points: certain truth, nothingness and that reality is one. Just like dinosaurs predate humans the first chapter with the 3 starting points predate the connecting of â€œi think n i exist, distinctionâ€ and â€œreality is one, antidistinction. Which leads to that there is more to reality than can be contemplated meaning that its infinite. Thats chaper 2: like multiplication and division are much higher levels of mathematics than adding and subtracting, chaper 2 is higher than the starting points in chapter 1.
â€”â€”â€”
If you want to be altruistic/selfless you can think about the millions of lives lost or living as refugees due to religious wars and group-loyalties based on ideology/religion. What if group-loyalty could be, for everyone, based on a single universal ideology? Then friendship ties, shared histories, well-mixing personalities and the like would form groups that donÂ´t have a religious mission/an ideological drive. When all ideologies are erased â€“ and religions too â€“ then simple biological mechanisms like common goals, shared interests and family ties bind us together â€“ and those kind of conglomerations are more likely to disintegrate than if there is a holy book or any ideological book as the binding principle between people. If ISIS would be educated then it would disintegrate and many civil wars break out among different families in Iraq/Syria â€“ but there would not be this major cleft between western&modern and holy&dogmatic.
If you want to be selfish like Ayn Rand: the upcoming world order / economy will be a meritocracy based on who advances or knows the most science. The ancient Chinese had a government where even the lowest peasant, if he passed a test in ConfusciousÂ´ teachings, could elevate himself higher in the society. Hierarchy is based on what is objectively to be admired; hierarchy is based on what infinitely many extraterrestrials in consensus have agreed upon be the criteria for how a humanÂ´s thoughts should be wired; hierarchy is based on the universeÂ´s disposition to reward those with the most accurate world-view or whom advance the pre-existing world-view and spread it to others â€“ the universe wants us choose to elevate in the hierarchy those whom appriciate the universe most fully, wholistically and most accurately. The old power-system based on money is upheld by banks and is based on present day humansÂ´ ties to the past. There will be an overlap between the old bank-based system for establishing VIP-status and the new economy which is a meritocracy based on science. If we want to be like planets ahead of us in the evolution of history, we ought to adapt the meritocracy-economy. After a few generations inherited money seems less legitimate than knowing or advancing science and by doing so wiring oneÂ´s cortex (flexible thinking part of the brain) as universally as possible (as much like the consensus among extraterrestrials is as possible).
There are three universal starting points for the universal course which will wire your brain universally. What I mean by â€œuniversalâ€ is that:
A) it is based on science meaning that it is retrievable from anywhere at any time; it is available universally unlike some time-specific language-specific location-specific holy-book-revalation.
B) universal means that it is how aliens/extraterrestrials sooner or later wire their brains. Sure: they can choose to live in a multi-worldviewical world but sooner or later the truth will conquer meaning that all various ideas among every tribe or nation will congregate (like a lens focuses many beams of light into one focal point) into a single set of ideas and prioritarizations â€“ a single world-view will emerge from the many. It is the identical world-view that all civilizing planets will congregate to/toward because science is universal. This congregating is as much of a universal step in evolution as that a planet with water will eventually have bacteria. Eventually everyone will know the course and the idea of this book. â€œWhat do you believe?â€ will no longer be a question because everyone has wired their cortexÂ´s ideas based on universal ideas/science.
â€”â€”â€“
Am I a muslim?
I have my size-time-diagram into which everything fits and this diagram being infinite gives an existential theory because:
â€“ sizes justify (are the cause of) one another, so thereÂ´s infinite justification.
â€“ time is infinite and our universe is observed to become nothingness in the future, and nothingness would be absurd if not for the fact that in the smallest spaces energymass is summoned because E=mc2 is a stable, constant law of nature.
â€“ there can only be separate distinct entities if distinction is counter-balanced and happens in non-distinction (a singular Reality). This point is much like the previous point of that only in nothingness can somethingness be summoned.
God, then, if we are to look for a meaning for the word, cannot be:
â€“ a specific object, size nor time within something infinitely larger
â€“ cannot, by definition, be apart from and â€œbeyondâ€ [that of which all is part] (Reality). Reality being an infinite size- and time-range of energymasspacetime is enough of an existential theory to explain us being here, the Big Bang, and the rest of the questions. God would, if claimed to be â€œbeyondâ€ the existential theory, be an unnecessary unproven assumption but more to the point: God would be â€œunrealâ€ if Reality is defined as we define it here. Such â€œbeyond Realityâ€-gods are unreal. WhatÂ´s more is that the phrase â€œAllah akbarâ€ (God is the biggest/greatest) wouldnÂ´t be true if Reality/[that of which all is part] is God plus Reality â€“ if [that of which all is part] has two major components, God and an energymasspacetime sizerange etc (the existential theory), then the sum of those two components is greater than God.
God, thus, obviously means Reallity by the definition of God being the greatest. God is then infinite. It makes sense to see people in awe over how much they can study, when they know thereÂ´s infinitely many fields of science which we do not have access to but which are logical and necessities for Reality to hold together. There being nothing absurd in an infinite size-range that resembles our known size-range (from quantum physics to the visible universe) is awesome and the highest you could possibly worship. This again proves that God is just a synonym for Reality/the existential theory.
Having studied all fields of science i.e. all sizes is the known sizerange, seeing how they all make up (justify) eachother (that itÂ´s just zooming in and zooming out), the wisdom that the sizerange is infinite (that there are infinitely many sizes making up one another) from the distinction (I think & I am logical path) and anti-distinction (that Reality is one) -thing, is the reason why we exist and God is not some size (sizes are not minds, except through evolution). Having studied all known sizes and knowing that the sizerange is infinite: it is an explanation to why weÂ´re here (akin to the Adam and Eve story or â€œGod created earth in 6 daysâ€ story) but it is not a revalation-giving thing â€“ the Quran wasnÂ´t written by God because God is not the kind of thing that writes/dictates stories. God being an infinite sizerange as thus our Creator is true, but the true way to get knowledge, rituals/pictoral representations and even guidance is through my work, not the work of the holy book-writers. The holy book writers might have said something true about God (just like I do in my work) â€“ but that is true of science textbooks moreso â€“ and they all said false things such as that God talks/gives revalations/authors holy books.
I can see the bronze-age marketing-teamÂ´s standpoint: people are more prone to follow dictates if theyÂ´re said to come from something/someone â€œhigher than humanâ€ i.e. a God or a ghost/spirit. Being invisible in as nonsense-a-way as some rituals are, is great for marketing. Everyone knows how humans thing â€“ theyÂ´re themselves human; we are only partly rational (a computer is rational) in what we think â€“ all our animal lusts bias or interrupt the thoughts that are as logical as they get, but theyÂ´re always going to be based against an evolutionary background just like the pitfall that my abstract diagram-including infinity-mentioning world-view is more like algebra than â€œwhat a world-view (context in which we are) should be thinking about that we lived for millions of years on the savannah, only needing to know (in oneÂ´s world-view) where the water-source is or whom stands under whom in the social hierarchy. WeÂ´ve mapped geographies, the use-based properties of objects/tools and personalities (and still do) for a gazillion years â€“ only with the advent of science SOME of us achieved higher i.e. used their evolved meager toolkit with all its biases to scetch out something like the theory of evolution in the 1800s. Looking at the evolution of [what we use our memory for]/how we map our surroundings/our world-view, before we mapped social relationships we mapped geographies. Before we mapped the functions of inventions (tools) our map only contained caveman tools (sharp stones and spears). The next step is to map oneÂ´s context as an infinite size-time-diagram (where size and time are really the same, but abstract thinking allows us to separate them into two distinct axises) or energymasspacetime (with itsÂ´ many laws of nature found in every school textbook in the world) and the distinction-antidistinction-
thing which feels so awkward/abstract that one wonders why one needs it as pillar 3 of the existential theory: the answer is: it wasnÂ´t invented (the words â€œI see a distinct objectâ€ or â€œwhy is there distinction?â€ werenÂ´t said in the same breath as â€œReality is oneâ€ or â€œenergymass and spacetime uniteâ€) until I did it in the 21st century). It might seem trivial to mention that separate entities exist in a singular Reality â€“ itÂ´s so obvious (thatÂ´s why no-one cared to make a big fuzz out of inventing it) but it makes the existential theory have three pillars (all of which can seem obvious) and not 4 â€“ thereÂ´s nothing more to add to the existential theory once youÂ´ve added the obvious â€œseparation in antidistinctionâ€-statement. I want to know how aliens (the infinitely many of them, steered by science toward an incommon path) think because its synonymous to finding a TRUE â€œkey to historyâ€ (Marx thought the key was equality, Hitler thought the key was racial superiority and a brutally competative relationship between races, Capitalism thinks itÂ´s freedom (less government), some might think they â€œkey to historyâ€ is to fund technological development). â€œHow aliens thinkâ€ is a shorthand way of saying â€œthe key to historyâ€ or â€œwhat will happen next/eventually and in hindsight seen as akin to the era of ancient grecoroman culture, the Industrial Revolution or the Digital revolution)â€. ItÂ´s what weÂ´re steered towards; itÂ´s the closest thing we get to divine guidance. ItÂ´s simply universal (drawn on science and practiced by infinitely many aliens) guidance/suggestions/
recommendations that we, as a species, can choose to promogate and thus â€œfollowâ€ or if weÂ´ll stick to multiculturalismÂ´s many -ismÂ´s like political quran-based islamism or christian-based â€œthe holy book gave me thisâ€-morality and codes of conduct. Some -ismÂ´s are dangerous (like quran-based politics and law) while some -ismÂ´s like christianity give too much credit to the -ism for simple human decency (in an age of extreme wealth globally). When my tummy is full IÂ´m a decent person â€“ I try to make money but IÂ´m not desparate after extreme wealth because I know that my caveman-brainÂ´s â€œneedâ€ for power (through status-symbols and freedom of space my environment to maximize the effectiveness of my hobby (writing)) wonÂ´t get satisfied no matter what external extravaganzas trigger my eyeballs, nor can people (socializing) make me much more satisfied than I am right now because all that is interesting and that there is to people is their brain â€“ and after a few weeks together thereÂ´ll be nothing I know nor any mental tool that I use that wonÂ´t, despite copyright, be in the hands of my friend: we wonÂ´t talk science (me teaching him/her) after all the science has been taught. I donÂ´t care to teach trivia so when I say â€œI teach SCIENCEâ€ I mean a finite thing: the existential theory plus something from each level of the known sizerange. Getting a P.hD from specializing on finding the structure of a rare protein only found in the feet of Amazonian forrest-mice is to put your eyes too close to the diagram; P.hDs for specializing/having a very narrow topic for oneÂ´s mind to engage in are for people who donÂ´t see the forest for the trees and care to rather look at one leaf of one tree instead of thinking about and seeing the forest as a whole. IÂ´m a forest person â€“ a leaf 10 cm from my eyes just bugs me. ThatÂ´s why there is a finite repertoire to what I call â€œscienceâ€ â€“ it takes a few days for me (my accomplishment/my work) to be fully understood and if repeated repetative. One only needs to know why/where one exists (the existential theory) once â€“ one canÂ´t forget it because we are made to remember the very context in which we live (here an evolutionary bias helps us: when someone explains â€œwhat the world isâ€ we remember it because â€œwhat the world wasâ€ in caveman days was the most useful thing the brain could do â€“ in fact we evolved such large brains because bigger brains remember better (can moreso map social relationships, successfull or unsuccesfull learning-experiences). We want to climb upwards in the hierarchy, find a mate, etc but all these wants and needs would be useless (theyÂ´d having nothing to work on) if it werenÂ´t for the map (of social relationships etc) that our brain is capable of remembering. We are inclined to remember existential theories because such knowledge about our place in the context was as useful as mapping whom is married to whom. This bias, by the way, is something holy book writers used to get people interested in their book. â€œGod created earth in 6 days (not 5)â€ is memorable because of our bias toward wanting to know about â€œcreation of the worldâ€ â€“ so the number â€œ6 daysâ€ is remembered too because it adds to the map that we then work on to seek power and other evolutionary benefits. ItÂ´s hard to make plans that have one reach evolutionary benefits if one does not know oneÂ´s environment/the external world. â€œ6 days for creating this place/worldâ€ adds to oneÂ´s map of the environment/place/external world. We have a bias for remembering it. Too bad the bronze-age holy books used this marketing trick (â€œhey, letÂ´s say something about their world (like the creation of it) because that would be something they remember!â€) to give pseudo- existential theories. The holy books made sales because not only do people want information about their context, people also want God to talk and interfere with day-to-day personal activites. Once you have a pseudo-explanation for how/why the world was created, youÂ´re free to add to that pseudo-explanation that â€œthe creator talksâ€. ItÂ´s impossible to add such a talking thing to my existential theory â€“ not only is it unnecessary (my theory works stand-alone) but it also contradicts basically every concept of my existential theory. The very definitions of energymasspacetime (meaning that God had nothingness as the canvas to paint on â€“ a nothingness that needs energymass and summons it because of the laws of nature inherent in that nothingness â€“ and chose to paint a beginning with as-dense-as-can-be (just like E=mc2 wouldÂ´ve created it because E=mc2 is true in the smallest spaces). Where was God when this happened? CouldnÂ´t have been energymass because energymass is only summoned once the universe becomes pure nothingness. If God is not energymass and energymass is existence â€“ then God doesnÂ´t exist / God is nothing. What doesnÂ´t exist or is nothing doesnÂ´t give revalations to men, doesnÂ´t care whom you sleep with, etc. Is God or GodÂ´s heaven a location in our size of infinite spacetime? In that case God is simply a far-away alien (which warrants questions about its evolution) but again â€“ it doesnÂ´t talk to us because of the distance and we wouldnÂ´t be too impressed even if an evolved God did talk to us (we are quite like it â€“ our science is the same, our world-view is the same). God is not a location in a size but is God a size? The sizerange is infinite (as proven by distinction not being able to see antidistinction) and thatÂ´d mean that thereÂ´s a creator to God (and that thing too has a creator, ad infinitum) IN THE SAME WAY as humans built cities or atoms make molecules. Again, if God is a size it warrantÂ´s the question: is God every location of that size or is God, like humans, in a location of that size? Whatever be the case, God still couldnÂ´t communicate with us. Since God fits neither in the context of energymasspacetime nor the context of the sizerange, a God-theory absolutely contradicts the true theory. What is said about God â€“ that God is the greatest â€“ makes only one â€œlocationâ€/notion in the existential theory correspond to a non-talking uncaring God: the theory itself (and more precisely Reality/[that of which all is part]) is the greatest. It certainly doesnÂ´t hear/talk nor give revalations because it comes as an infinite sizerange of energymasspacetime. When you tell this science, you can get to the point where you define Reality as â€œthat of which all is partâ€ and the greatest â€“ you can even get to antidistinction/the unrepresentability of Reality (fully, because we do represent some things) and people might still hope that a talking God can exist. But as soon as you mention the less abstract (the more abstract was that [that of which all is part cannot be observed]), the God-theory either surrenders or is in conflict with a/the existential theory which certainly is true (anyone can verify how the components of the theory fit together, make sense and explain everything). God as a synonym for Reality is boring â€“ why do we even have two words if we mean the same (scientific sizerange) thing.
If you assume that God is a synonym for Reality (which comes as an infinite sizescale, which in turn predicts a DNA-strand somewhere and voila: everything is explained), then I believe in your God. It doesnÂ´t appriciate my appriciation of it though, nor do rituals, following rules (made by men) etc please it. If I am to â€œshow my appriciation to itâ€ I do it by writing as I do right now â€“ thatÂ´s my worship of it: but IÂ´m under no illusion that this writing would please God by being logical (eventhough Reality itself is logical too â€“ so we have something incommon) â€“ me writing can be called worship but the only appriciating recipients of my writing are me and readers of my text. Whatever I write about Reality/God doesnÂ´t please God (because God is not a thing that listens, likes worship by others and other human needs) â€“ whatever worshippers do, I hope they do it for themselves and for other humans because no-one else is able to care or comprehend the worship. I would do the muslim prayer if I felt that that kind of discipline would benefit me (and a few times I did get a good feeling from going to the mosque and being among worshippers). ItÂ´s so easy to adapt to the customs of oneÂ´s peers (and especially oneÂ´s superiors, if one believes that there are those) that my attitude toward worship/ritual is â€œwhen in Rome, do like the romans (if you or others gain something out of it)â€. The world is complex â€“ I could have the same attitude toward the beliefs of islam: that IÂ´ll just say that something is through eventhough it obviously isnÂ´t because it contradicts, say, a talking holy book-writing God. Could I make myself believe that something talkative is God? The belief disintegrates and I get the foul feeling of that IÂ´ve used my valuable memory to note down a lie everytime I would think just one step/association further from the belief itself. I can believe (in anything) but analyzing it even the smallest amount will make me disbelieve it. But when youÂ´re in the mood of not analyzing â€“ like when one is having a panic attack on oneÂ´s death-bed â€“ IÂ´ll be (extremely) simplistic and do what some people seem to always do: â€œbelieve (in something that breaks down when analyzed)â€. What confuses me is that some people believe all the time â€“ they seem perfectly sane but they believe in a talking, scripture-giving God (that doesnÂ´t fit anywhere in the existential theory). Do they need comfort (from untruth) all the time? It seems like theyÂ´re trying to argue their position, though. A perplexing phenomenon at first glance but when you consider that theyÂ´re uneducated about my existential theory, any theory will do (even a talking God-theory). I am not hateful of it when I see it in other people â€“ I see it as humorous/ridicilous â€“ but when it binds people together (to form what in essence is an army) and thereÂ´s many of them (10 000 religions/â€armiesâ€) the worldÂ´s got a problem. Binding people together through their shared scripture and their belief that something impossible is true is bad because groups tend to be more violent than individualists â€“ especially if their holy text 1) seems to bind billions of people to their army (morale-strength amplification in a group is the root of violence), and 2) preaches violence/disrespect (many holy books are xenophobic and eager to create an â€œus vs. themâ€-social dynamic). If the holy book is taken seriously (if it canÂ´t be thrown in the trash) then we have bronze-age xenophobia (based on who likes the book and who doesnÂ´t) creeping into the modern day, and we also have artificial bonding/loyalty â€“ we basically get groups who are hostile (or more disrespectful) toward anyone who doesnÂ´t see the point (â€œthereÂ´s a talking Godâ€) theyÂ´re promoting. ItÂ´s such an easily fixable problem: if you read my work you simply cannot believe in a talking God â€“ my professional role is that you can give me ANY individual and I can â€œconvertâ€ him/her into not believing in a talking God. Whether this person will follow his or her groupÂ´s rituals or codes of conduct, though, is up to them â€“ itÂ´s sheer peer pressure.
The â€œus vs. themâ€ â€œwe are a big groupâ€ (and especially) â€œwe should convert the whole world so that they use their precious memory for knowing nonsense like we doâ€ are such great reasons for violence â€“ and of course itÂ´s fixable because what these people lack is education: only where there is no theory, can a pseudo-theory take root. Only where there is no argument/debate/science can â€œGod talksâ€ seem like legitimate truth. This means that much of the worldÂ´s violence is due to a lack of education (about the big questions i.e. what I talk about). Sure: some religions can be interpreted to say â€œkill the infidelsâ€ or some other explicit declaration of war â€“ but itÂ´s hard for a religion to survive if it constantly preaces fighting (it must have more clever tactics than that â€“ but it does tend to seek world-dominion). IÂ´m not so worried that someone reads the Quran and thinks â€œIÂ´ll help the [unbelieves in the QuranÂ´s talking God] to get to hell faster, because the Quran says that thatÂ´s where they belongâ€. I am worried about that the Quran (or any holy book) is the glue that binds people together. Religion is the last glue before we enter an era where obviously arbitrary things like nationalism or language makes strangers feel more familiar with eachother. Nation and language arenÂ´t taken that seriously â€“ nor should religion be, but it is. This binding-effect that holy books have is what makes ISIS / the taliban etc so hard to defeat â€“ they think, not only that they have an all-seeing revalation-giving God on their side, but they also have the exact same copy of a book that a billion people have. They feel strong (with their, seemingly to them, superior numbers). Obviously ISIS underestimated the ability of the Quran to draw in arab nations into the fight over Iraq & Syria â€“ the modern world simply leaned on the fact that ISIS are not muslims because they interpret the bronze-age ramble wrong. But ISIS / the taliban is still a factor â€“ the quran binds too many people together in certain areas of the world â€“ violence is caused, due to the binding-effect, the â€œmoral superiorityâ€-effect, the â€œpower in numbers and billions of people read the Quranâ€-effect etc (all these effects are there even if you skip the parts about the talking God who word for word said the Quran) make men as prone to violence as anything can make them: theyÂ´re a group with an â€œus vs. themâ€ dogma & feeling and they feel like they have power in numbers. Add to that the frustration over having to finance an own home before one can ejaculate. Those circumstances can make the group take up arms and â€œsend the infidels where they belongâ€. Following the commandments frustrates, the whole notion of â€œletÂ´s all prioritize this text highest (our favorite book) so that weÂ´re bound togetherâ€ and that the text itself can be interpreted as violent all are a breeding-ground for trouble â€“ and when youÂ´re in the trouble that the text creates, you are not in the state of mind to do the internal debate necessary to disprove a talking God and thus make your whole way of life become something that you either do as meaningless fun or donÂ´t do because no-one cares. But just as some people want to become professional soccer players and some atheists do zen-meditation, humans (by personal preference) want hobbies, to take up a discipline, to do something that adds, say, pride to their life. I donÂ´t personally care about soccer and I donÂ´t feel pride from doing any ritual, but I can definitely see that others take the muslim prayers like an athlete takes their sport. ItÂ´s possible to find out the objective truth about whether these prayers â€œplease God or notâ€ (by, like IÂ´ve done in this text, disproving all kinds of false Gods and making the real God more mundane and not a talker). Rituals donÂ´t please Reality/â€the energymasspacetime sizerangeâ€ because it is not a thing that gets pleased â€“ itÂ´s like trying to please a rock. You do the prayers because you enjoy the pride/hobby for its own sake â€“ like someone doing sports likes his/her sport. Pleasing a rock/God to get to a â€œheavenâ€ (which too doesnÂ´t fit into the true existential theory) is stupid unless itÂ´s akin to a hobby/sport where you do it for doing itÂ´s sake. Same thing with the â€œheaven hates hamâ€-thing â€“ when you know enough science (enough = what IÂ´ve written so far in this text) youÂ´ll realize that the whole ham-prohibition is man-made (from the bronze age) and linked to some pre-scientific nonsense from-the-horseÂ´s-mouth-
statement (canÂ´t say rationale because itÂ´s dogma). If you (and secondarily your peers) are dedicated to nonsense (whether it be sports, stamp-collecting, memorizing capitals or not eating pork), then do it if it does something good like prove to yourself (and others) that you have a strong discipline (even though your effort is misdirected toward nonsense). I can invent a ritual and do it every day, and maybe IÂ´d feel pride over that I can keep to a schedule of nonsense, but I would never claim the theory that there is a talking God, and by extention I wouldnÂ´t say that that ficticious talker prohibited ham. The mundane action must be differentiated from the logical argument. Ham-prohibitions and talking Gods are artifacts that belong in the past â€“ modern white A4-paper is too beautiful for someone to write something as erroneous as â€œthere is a talking Godâ€ on it. But as IÂ´m writing this, people are dying because religion binds them together (and frustrates them, and boosts their war-morale in many ways). My work can cause a civil war within ISIS â€“ a civil rift so permiating that only family ties, friendships and common goals (to get money, not to spread islam) can keep people together in groups. Once my existential theory is known there will still be crime and instability in Iraq, Syria and Afghanistan, but the evil deeds will only be committed by groups of 2-3 people â€“ not 20 000 of them. The binding effect of the Quran can most clearly be seen in that internet-propaganda made Quran-readers from the USA and Europe go fight in Syria â€“ everyone wants a group and itÂ´s totally human to assume that knowing the same book will be enough for a bond to be as strong as one wants it to be.
Right now â€œmy workâ€ is 9 proper texts and a few videos. They all talk about the same thing (which can be formulated as: IÂ´ll say as much as I can about things IÂ´ve never heard anyone else say (and IÂ´ve seen the best professors in the world teaching truths)). To cause a rift in the taliban/ISIS and stop the war by making group-bonding (around a holy book) problematic/impossible, my whole â€œworkâ€ doesnÂ´t need to be dropped as propaganda books on top of ISIS and the taliban. ItÂ´s enough that the news headlines say that â€œa correct all-explaining existential theory has been found â€“ religions in crysisâ€ or that enough people know my theory so that a multitude of youtube videos are made where, in a sentence or two, the presenter goes off-topic and mentions why we exist / something from my theory. Having understood it once makes it impossible to forget â€“ having understood it once makes group-bonding over religion (which fuels ISIS/the taliban/etc) impossible. If the world could just take 20 minutes of itsÂ´ time to spend on explaining/teaching/arguing my work/theory, then the war on terror would be over â€“ otherwise it will persist as long as people have no actual, logical theory about their existence and thus believe in bronze-age marketing tricks.
â€”â€”-
The theory of evolution begins with the first reproducing shape. It was a shape that assembled surrounding mass into a similar shape. The existential theory predicts the existence of infinitely many such shapes. What inevitable becomes true when you have reproduction is that some die and some survive (life and death), that the number of offspring that shape make matters and that there is mutations over time. This is true about the shapeÂ´s offspring: some will die and some will survive, the number of offspring they make matters and the offspring can be different from the original shape. These three rules / laws of nature were inactive before the first reproduction occurred. The next main event was that one of these shapes found that if it injected its DNA into other shapesÂ´ reproductive mechanism, it exploited principle number two: that the number of offspring matters. It was the first virus: it hijacked othersÂ´ reproduction. The rule / law of nature that came into play with this event was that â€œpowerâ€ matters: hijacking othersÂ´ reproductive mechanism gives evolutionary benefits. Now weÂ´ve listed the four main rules that govern evolutionary theory: first came the three first, and then came the forth: power. The next main event â€“ to guard against viruses taking over all life / reproductive mechanisms â€“ was that an immune system evolved to protect against virusÂ´ hijack attempts. This required multicellularism. Just like immune systems prompt/require multicellularism, immune systems prompt/require multigenderedism: to win in the arms race against quickly mutating viruses two genders arose to amplify the mutations to the immune system. Mixing genes from two genders creates a more mutated immune system, which can keep ahead in the arms race against quickly-mutating viruses â€œtryingâ€ to mutate to bypass any immune system. The next main event is that one of these multicellular organisms â€“ a fish or worm â€“ of the male gender mutated to be agressive and defeat other males in battle. He wouldÂ´ve gotten access to many more females than his non-agressive counter-parts. This too can be called â€œpowerâ€ because the agressive male hijacks other maleÂ´s access to females by killing the males. This prompts the dinosaurs because larger muscle mass and shaper weaponry is better at killing off competitors. Amongst the dinosaurs there was the mother-offspring bond, placed there by evolution for the evolutionary benefits a mother gets from seeing an offspring survive to adulthood. This bond mutated to involve flock-members because a group working together out-competes any individualists when fighting over anything. The next main event was that someone mapped the flock, in his brain, as a hierarchy (up-down-axis) with the longing to dominate peers.

Dude, evolution has me try to maximize evolutionary benefits using my plans; im always thinking at full speed and pain drives that thinking. And i know for certain that all this pain is meaningless. Its a suicide recipe but what prevents me from suicide is the natural strength that stems from being the pinnacle of beasts who all have survived for generations.

New book 2017
Chapter 1:
What problem does this solve?
This solves a problem that becomes most visible 60 years from now when sea-levels rise, the economy goes into permanent decline and oil ends. ThatÂ´s when humans start to fight (and belong in world-view-based groups to do so). While the economy is still rising the clashes are few and far between â€“ Afghanistan, Syria, ISISÂ´ world-wide terror attacks (mainly muslim world-views clashing with tolerant world-views). When the economy starts declining thereÂ´ll naturally be more friction between groups, and groups are made up of world-views (people identify as in a group based on world-view).
Advancing the scientific world-view to the level where it explains our origin and thus invades religious intellectual turf, solves the problem of world-views colliding as war.
Chapter 2:
Certain truth â€“ I think & I am
You have a composite certain truth consisting of two certain truths: you can claim as certain that you think (because if you were being fooled: being fooled is thinking) and that you exist (because being fooled requires the one who is fooled to be there). I think and I exist is one statement but two truths. You can certainly claim to have â€œdistinctionâ€ because youÂ´re dealing with multiple separate distinct entities (such as â€œIâ€ and â€œthoughtâ€). One could put it, while seeing the certain truths â€œI thinkâ€ and â€œI existâ€, that the space between the two notions (thinker and thought) is the hallmark of distinction. The distance separating thinker from thought we can recognize as necessary for â€œdistinctionâ€ to be concluded as a certain truth arising, in a next logical step, from the original primary certain truth.
Everyone agrees they they themselves exist, because if one would get fooled in everyone one can be fooled in then one would exist there anyway and be fooled. So one knows that one exists. Then one also knows that one thinks because â€œto get fooledâ€ is a thought-process. Thus we have two things: I think and I exist. And the distinction between them: and on the flipside of the paper we have the opposite of that: anti-distinction, and this can also be called â€œthat of which all is partâ€/Reality. And since we are in the distinction-side of the paper when we see something; when we see something there is distinction between us and that thing. Thus we cannot represent or see that which is on the other side of the paper i.e. that of which all is part / Reality. Nothing can represent â€“ because it is distinct â€“ Reality. So whatever which is distinct cannotâ€¦ whatever that is observed or represented is distinct and therefore is notâ€¦ therefore does not represent Reality / â€œthat of which all is partâ€. So we have distinction and anti-distinction as opposing poles.
You have a certain truth which everyone in the whole world agrees upon. You think and you exist since if you were being fooled by an almighty demon youÂ´d still both think and exist. Then there are two things i.e. distinction. All is part of a single reality which is anti-distinction, there are no separate parts: reality is one. If we put distinction on the left side of the paper and anti-distinction on the right side then (we) distinction cannot see that of which all is part because â€œto seeâ€ is â€œto representâ€ and then one uses something to refer to reality. There is nothing outside reality which can refer to reality but instead reality is defined as â€œthat of which all is partâ€ and then there is nothing that can refer to all of reality. The opposition between the two sides of the paper (distinction & anti-distinction) makes reality as â€œthat of which all is partâ€-anti-distinction non-representable because representation always involves distinction. What we see, for example, is just parts of reality. The hypotheses can be infinitely much so there is infinitely much to reality. Sizes and times, that is. In the existential theory (â€œwhy we existâ€) there, thus, is an infinite size-range with time, energymass in spacetime (everything and nothing intertwined like in the E=mc2 equation â€“ energy equals mass times, well â€“ spacetime; multiplication is what unites energymass with spacetime). Then we have distinction and anti-distinction: separate things but all is part of a single reality. The existential theory with its three pillars, that is an infinite sizerange, energymasspacetime and distinction-anti-distinction-opposition, predicts that there should be a tiny piece of DNA which copies itself.
Then thereÂ´s another kind of revelation that got respect. Descartes who lived in the 1600s got respect, fame and was invited to live with the Queen of Sweden because he had gotten an idea which certainly told us something true. Revelations can either be con menÂ´s statements like they were from ape-man and forward, or they can actually claim something which is verifyably true. Descartes, propably having his mind overcrowded by the masses of revelations that had accumulated to his time, asked: â€œwhat would be true if all my statements were false?â€. What would remain if I tossed all my knowledge and ideas into the trash? Are we stuck with countless unverifyable statements, some contradicting eachother, not knowing which ones are true and which ones are not? Obviously not since statements about architecture are obviously true since they build houses, while contradictory statements do not. So Descartes dared to throw all his knowledge in the trash to see what remained. He found certain truth: that he exists â€“ because even if he was wrong or was being fooled in everything he thought to be true, thereÂ´d still be a â€œheâ€ there. He certainly exists no matter what. Same thing goes for thoughts: being wrong or being fooled is a thinking-process so even if he was wrong or was being fooled in everything he thought, thereÂ´d still be thought.
Socrates: So he figured out that he thinks and he exists.
God: These are not one statement â€“ they are two.
Socrates: What does that mean?
God: IÂ´ll tell you later â€“ just agree with me that there is distinction between thinker and thought â€“ that the statements are two. ItÂ´s building on certain truth, and itÂ´s possible to build a wholeâ€¦ whatever it is that â€œsaves the worldâ€ from the coming economic decline by having everyone build on certain truth until the God-debate is settled. Remembering â€œdistinctionâ€ (between thinker and thought) will prevent the horror-scenario of large-scale future wars between people group-bound by religions, and instead â€“ since everyone built a whole world-view on certain truth â€“ have a more stable decline in the future. â€œDistinctionâ€ i.e. remembering that there are two certain truths (thinker and thought) is a step on the way toward a plan that will save humanity from destroying itself as much as it would if we didnÂ´t build our world-views on certain truth.
Plato: So after an era of â€œrevelationâ€-revelations invented by anyone for whatever purpose, coming from DarwinÂ´s ape-manÂ´s revelations, Descartes, in the 1600s, invented a revelation â€“ certain truth: I think and I exist â€“ which got him invited to the Queen of Sweden for the rest of his life. People have always liked revelations and even verifyable truth-claims like DescartesÂ´ get respect.
God: I have set it as true that each one of you humans can verify in your own mindÂ´s eye that you do certainly exist and that there certainly is thought â€“ and thus there is distinction.
Darwin: Distinction is an abstract word. That two objects are separate/different from one another is one of those notions and ape-man never made into language â€“ there was never the evolutionary need to talk about â€œdistinctionâ€. Yes: one could say that one banana is different from another (and one wants the bigger one), but to have Distinction exist stand-alone as a distinct notion is abstract thinking and we are not evolved to do that. For millions of years the caveman word for â€œdistinctionâ€ was only used in a sentance â€“ not stand-alone as in â€œdistinction certainly exists because thinker and thought are both certain truthsâ€.
Chapter 3:
Distinction-antidistinction-opposition
The first proof for that the size-time-diagram is infinite is distinctionÂ´s (our) inability to see/represent anti-distinction.
Chapter 4:
Maximum size?
The second prooof for that the size-time-diagram is infinite is that if we imagine a partless anti-distinction then it has no distinction as in a â€œmaximumâ€ or â€œminimumâ€ size, i.e. the size-range is infinite.
Chapter 5:
Infinite size-time-diagram
Chapter 6:
Existential theoryÂ´s 3 pillars
Chapter 7:
Prediction of DNA

Everyone agrees on that reality is one. Because itÂ´s one nothing can represent it, because the representer too should be part of reality. That means that there is a size-time-diagram which is infinite. And thatÂ´s why we exist. Everyone agrees on this eventhough we are distinct unique individuals. We have this world-view incommon, with extraterrestrials too.

You know for certain that you think and that you exist because even if an almighty demon was fooling you in everything you can possibly be fooled in, the fooling itself is a thought-process and therefore you know that thought exists (you think), and for you to be fooled you have to exist and therefore you know "I exist". Being fooled is thinking and a thinker is necessary for there to be someone to be fooled. So you know: no matter what, you think and you exist. Those are two things, right? TheyÂ´re both part of the same brain and the thought-process can become the analytical toolkit/thinker, but still we recognize that there are distinct entities - there is distinction. This can also be called separation. What is distinctionÂ´s opposite, anti-distinction? ItÂ´s one reality; that of which all is part; itÂ´s one and realityÂ´s definition in the dictionary is that all is part of it. If we write distinction (thinker and thought) on the left side of the paper and anti-distinction (reality; that of which all is part; one) on the right side of the paper - can the left side see the right side? No, because of opposition between distinction and anti-distinction. Because of there always being an observer (a thinker) and thus distinction in every observation and thus anti-distinction canÂ´t be represented/seen.
The brain evolved to deal with natural occurances - there was never an event in history where something invisible was to be contemplated and dealt with. Thus we seem to assume that the thought-process went wrong when we say that distinction/us canÂ´t see anti-distinction/reality. But the thought-process didnÂ´t go wrong: all that it means is that there is more to reality than can be represented. Regardless of how vaguely "represents" is defined, say a coffee cup - regardless of brains being involved - is assumed to try to represent that of which all is part, then anti-dinstinction - distinction - opposition (the opposition between distinction and itÂ´s opposite) makes the representation incorrect. We can ask if there in an anti-distinct "thing" is a maximum size and thus distinction? No. Likewise, another proof for that the size-range is infinite is that we do sense something (our everyday world) and can make hypotheses ad infinitum, and yet nothing represent
s ALL OF reality. Reality i.e. s
ize-time thus is infinite.
The infinite size-range is one pillar in the existential theory. Another pillar is energymass and spacetime being opposites but intertwined as in E=mc
2
(where c
2
refers to a speed which is space over time: spacetime). Multiplication joins energymass together with spacetime; nothing together with something/everything; existence together with non-existence. Why is there existence the shape of my body? Without going into the historical answer, one can explain it by saying that the body is something in (intertwined with) nothing, of a size in an infinite size-range (where the relationship between any two sizes (or objects of two sizes) i
s that they make sense of i.e. j
ustify one another). Then there too, as a third pillar, is distinction-an
ti-distinction-opposition i.e. w
e live in a single (not plural) reality but we see distinct/separate entities such as thinker and thought.
Speaking of spacetime, spacetime is the logical starting point for the time-based existential theory.
Nothingness (empty space) needs n
o prior justification nor reason to exist, because it doesnÂ´t exist. In it, however
, laws of nature are true i.e. i
t is not irrational / anti-logical, and among the many laws of nature there are those, including E=mc
2
, which mention energymass.
Could energymass be "mentioned" without it existing? If yes, it would be absurd / anti-logical. Why would reality mention things that never exist? But since laws of nature are firm and because of our rule "what is mentioned must exist or must be summoned" we get, wherever (in the smallest spaces) that E=mc
2
is mentioned, existence and thus dense existence: a big bang. The fact that galaxies are speeding away acceleratingly from one another leads to nothingness in the future, and with the middleman "laws of nature" again energymass is summoned as dense as can be. No time-delay between nothingness - laws of nature - energymass but as soon as a bordered (by event horizons which are determined by the finite speed of light) region becomes nothingness, a big bang occurs and eventually becomes nothingness bordered by event horizons again. This is the time-wise description of why energymass (which exists intertwined with spacetime as in E=mc
2
) starts dense and becomes nothingness, and repeats.
All of the above is a rival theory to "God created earth in 6 days and rested on the 7th". It is unintuitive because it deals with things we didnÂ´t have to deal with in evolution: invisible energymasspacetime/reality/anti-distinction as a part of reasoning. It also has a multi-reason cause for our existence: a time-wise rationale involving the beginning and end of the big bang combined with a 3-pillar existential theory which justifies size and energymass. It is abstract/scientific but canÂ´t be reduced into simpler terms. ItÂ´s the lowest common denominator that everyone can believe in (regardless of religion).
How many is reality? One. How many is Allah? One. Can anything completely represent reality? No. Can anything completely represent Allah? No. Is reality the greatest (if all is part of it)? Yes. Is â€œAllah akbarâ€? Yes. Reality and Allah have these three things incommon â€“ so maybe reality is synonymous with Allah?
How vaguely has reality defined â€to representâ€?
Infinitely vaguely â€“ anything can represent anything.
Is the representation/representer reality or Allah?
No.
Can anything represent that of which all is part?
No.
Then the size-time-diagram is infinite i.e. nothing represents reality. How many is it? How many is Allah? 1.
Did it sayâ€¦, or did it wri
te a book?
This disproves Allah writing the Quran.
Again: how much of reality can be represented by, say, a painting? The whole of it?
No, the whole of reality cannot be represented. Just like Allah canÂ´t be captured in a picture/word.
We can have hypotheses â€“ how many hypotheses can we have?
If reality is sizes & times, energymass and spacetime then the square-shaped size-time-diagram with energymasspacetime in each coordinate is the universal way to represent all there is to represent.
Does it write books? No, it is not of such authorship-kind nature.
â€œGod said to Muhammed word by wordâ€¦â€ is thus a false or at most metaphorical statement.
â€œYou have to do rituals in order not to go to hell, and in heaven you get 72 virginsâ€ is by the same logic also a false claim.
There are three alternatives as the foundation for this logic â€“ can you think of a 4
th
one?
1: Reality is a synonym for Allah
2: or Allah doesnÂ´t exist
3: or there are 72 virgins (not an alternative because reality is not of the nature, because it is size-time-energymasspacetime, to write books).
In addition to the square size-time diagram with infinity symbols in each of itÂ´s corners, and the evolutionary triangle which designates that life becomes more complex as time goes on
(the triangle originates at the central size of the known size-range), there is the following brain diagram:
You have a composite certain truth consisting of two certain truths: you can claim as certain that you think (because if you were being fooled: being fooled is thinking) and that you exist (because being fooled requires the one who is fooled to be there). I think and I exist is one statement but two truths. You can certainly claim to have â€œdistinctionâ€ because youÂ´re dealing
with multiple separate distinct entities (such as â€œIâ€ and â€œthoughtâ€). One could put it, while seeing the certain truths â€œI thinkâ€ and â€œI existâ€, that the space between the two notions (thinker and thought) is the hallmark of distinction. The distance separating thinker from thought we can recognize as necessary for â€œdistinctionâ€ to be concluded as a certain truth arising, in a next logical step, from the original primary certain truth.
Are all distinct entities part of a single reality if â€œrealityâ€ is defined as â€œthat of which all is partâ€? In other words: if we draw distinction on the left side of a paper and anti-distinction (distinctionÂ´s opposite: a singular reality â€“ that of which all is part. Zooming out summarizing maximally) on the right side of the paper, then can distinction represent the right side of the paper i.e. anti-distinction? How could some distinct entities depict the very opposite of what representation/distinction is? Any depiction/representation of anti-distinction/reality has at least three entities: thinker, space between thinker and thought, and thought. Separation/distinction is inherent in representation, thus anti-distinction is unrepresentable.
How vaguely has the universe/God defined what a representation is i.e. when a representation occurs? Our brains use neurons to represent, but what if â€“ instead of neurons (regardless of brains) â€“ the universe wills that any random object can be said to, as neurons do, represent reality? The universe has defined â€œrepresentationâ€ infinitely vaguely i.e. disregarding brains, any random object spontaneously is the symbol standing for all of reality â€“ because the universe defines â€œrepresentsâ€ infinitely vaguely. Despite the infinitely vague definition of what represents what, distinction-anti-distinction-opposition (the line separating the left side of the paper from the right side; the countering of distinction with anti-distinction) means that reality is not representable. If reality is anti-distinction then no distinction (representation is inherently distinction) can even, despite an infinitely vague definition of â€œrepresentsâ€, capture reality.
In
representations we can count at least three things and what weÂ´re trying to capture is one thing with nothing outside it. The fact that representations contain distinction makes capturing reality (all is one) impossible.
We can have infinitely many or infinitely large/substancefull representations/hypotheses â€“ such as an infinite size-time-diagram â€“ and though abstractly accurately pointing to reality, the universeÂ´s rule that nothing represents reality despite infinitely vaguely allowed representations of infinitely much, makes reality unrepresentable. This can only mean one thing: reality â€“ which we know as sizes and times (a size-time-diagram) â€“ is infinite. ThereÂ´s infinitely large and infinitely small with infinitely much past and infinitely much future. This square-shaped size-time-diagram i.e. our everyday experience of size-time has infinities all-over the place.
Energymass in spacetime: one in zero, existence in non-existence, something in nothing â€“ as defined by E=mc
2
where c
2
stands for speed (distance over time i.e. spacetime/zero/non-existence) and E=m referring to energymass (existence, something, all).
Distinction-anti-distinction-opposition: we live in a singular reality but we see multiple objects.
An infinite size-range.
The above three ideas are an existential theory (a theory which explains the existence of a reproducing shape and thus the dawn of evolution and thus our existence). It is modern to utilize three equal ideas to explain oneÂ´s existence â€“ all previous existential theories used either a single idea (monotheism) or a saga (multiple mundane (not very scientific/abstract) ideas) to explain existence.
The predictive quality that makes this existential theory a scientific theory is that it, basing it off an infinite size-range of energymasspacetime and distinction-anti-distinction-opposition, predicts that in an infinite size-range there ought to be a size where reproduction occurs. The existential theory predicts the first DNA, and from there we get to the evolutionary theory.
Another predictive quality is that the theory predicts a
dense
Big Bang. The a priori beginning of the universe logically is emptiness because emptiness doesnÂ´t need any prior logical justification for its existence because it doesnÂ´t exist. In emptiness laws of nature are true, such as the laws pointing toward and handleing energymass (like E=mc
2
), and thus the Big Bang begins infinitely dense because E=mc
2
is equally true simultaneously in the smallest of spaces. Tiny empty spaces having E=mc
2
be true in them simultaneously and directly as there was nothingness predicts a dense Big Bang. A region, contained within event horizons made out of energymasses speeding away at >c (due to dark energy causing accelerating cosmic expansion), is by definition â€œnothingâ€ in which E=mc
2
being true in the tiniest spaces summons a dense big bang out of reach of the closest (v = >c) energymass. Nothingness (out of reach for the closest energymasses because they are speeding away at >c) is summoned in the central point with event horizons as the furthest away border, causing Big Bang (due to laws of nature summoning energymass in the empty center).
The theory of evolution begins with the first reproducing shape. It was a shape that assembled surrounding mass into a similar shape. The existential theory predicts the existence of infinitely many such shapes. What inevitable becomes true when you have reproduction is that some die and some survive (life and death), that the number of offspring that shape make matters and that there is mutations over time. This is true about the shapeÂ´s offspring: some will die and some will survive, the number of offspring they make matters and the offspring can be different from the original shape. These three rules / laws of nature were inactive before the first reproduction occurred. The next main event was that one of these shapes found that if it injected its DNA into other shapesÂ´ reproductive mechanism, it exploited principle number two: that the number of offspring matters. It was the first virus: it hijacked othersÂ´ reproduction. The rule / law of nature that came into play with this event was that "power" matters: hijacking othersÂ´ reproductive mechanism gives evolutionary benefits. Now weÂ´ve listed the four main rules that govern evolutionary theory: first came the three first, and then came the forth: power. The next main event - to guard against viruses taking over all life / reproductive mechanisms - was that an immune system evolved to protect against virusÂ´ hijack attempts. This required multicellularism. Just like immune systems prompt/require multicellularism, immune systems prompt/require multigenderedism: to win in the arms race against quickly mutating viruses two genders arose to amplify the mutations to the immune system. Mixing genes from two genders creates a more mutated immune system, which can keep ahead in the arms race against quickly-mutating viruses "trying" to mutate to bypass any immune system. The next main event is that one of these multicellular organisms - a fish or worm - of the male gender mutated to be ag
g
ressive and defeat other males in battle. He wouldÂ´ve gotten access to many more females than his non-ag
g
ressive counter-parts. This too can be called "power" because the ag
g
ressive male hijacks other maleÂ´s access to females by killing the males. This prompts the dinosaurs because larger muscle mass and shaper weaponry is better at killing off competitors. Amongst the dinosaurs there was the mother-offspring bond, placed there by evolution for the evolutionary benefits a mother gets from seeing an offspring survive to adulthood. This bond mutated to involve flock-members because a group working together out-competes any individualists when fighting over anything. The next main event was that someone mapped the flock, in his brain, as a hierarchy (up-down-axis) with the longing to
be the top of the hierarchy. This capitalist striving for
the top made brains grew larger â€“ larger memory-banks, more accurate predictions and faster planning are all advantages coming
from a larger cortex.
Power lead men to accumulate resources â€“ the very resources females needed for their children. Females care most about their children because they pass on their genes, so in finding a male they aim for loyalty plus status/power/placement in the hierarchy. Females think a lot about how others â€“ especially suitors â€“ perceive them and therefore males evolved the subconscious mechanism, to keep womenâ€™sÂ´ attention, to push-pull i.e. to, in one coherent fluent conversation, both say negative feedback about the woman and positive feedback.
It is a major historical event that there finally is an atheistic argument that is sh
aped like a university course: i
t is an existential theory plus evolution which not only doesnÂ´t need a personified god to function, but the pillars (infinite sizerange of energymasspacetime and distinction-anti-distinction-opposition) canÂ´t have a personified god added to them as a 4th pillar without the theory sounding ridicilous. Not only does the theory not need a personified god but adding a god destroys the minimalistic rationally complete beauty of the theory. Gods uglify the theory. The dawn of the theory is a major historical event because never before has an entire course (beginning with certain truth, going through the existential theory and ending in evolution) been laid out in the intellectual debate of atheism, as an argument against a personified god.
The anatomy in the brain from hearing certain truth (I think & I am) - the beginning of the course - creates the same neuronal pathways / associations between ideas in every single person who knows certain truth. The logical step to "distinction" is noting, as a meta-analysis of the primary certain truth, that one has many ideas (I think AND I am) and that one can take logical pathways to the next step in the course (distinction exists). Then juxtaposing anti-distinction with distinction creates the unseeable - "defying reason" (because reason is, in simple people, only visual) - conclusion that we/distinction cannot see reality/anti-distinction. The distinction-anti-distinction-opposition is hard to grasp because it - like formal logic or math - uses words instead of pictures (the linguistic brainhalf rather than the visual one). We evolved to be like "if I see it I believe it" and that was a good heuristic (rule of thumb) because practical sequences of events can be verified as true or untrue by visualizing them. But in this philosophy: no - it has to be linguistic that we deny ourselves the concept "all of reality", leading to the conclusion that there is more to reality than anything - however vaguely the universe has defined "represent" - can represent. This adds infinitely many sizes to our abstract size-range / size-time-diagram; it makes a square (with size on the y-axis and time on the x-axis) with infinity symbols in each corner, which in turn becomes a pillar in our personified-god-denying existential theory.
To come from certain truth, through mere logical steps (meta-analyses and juxtaposition of opposites), to an existential theory which predicts evolution is a major historical event in the history of atheism.
In a historical context the anatomy (neural connections between ideas and sequences of logic) created by this course is like a paradigm-shift into a new era of earth society - an era similar to
that existent on infinitely many other planets who have come further than our midway-mark in a regular water-bearing planetÂ´s history.
Evolution, by beginning with "a mass that can assemble surrounding mass into a similar shape" steps forth from the existential theoryÂ´s infinite size-range of energymasspacetime. Assuming DNA is the replication-molecule, we can step - skipping over how cell walls evolved etc - to the fact that viruses mutate to hijack othersÂ´ reproductive system. This - in this universal inter-planetary extraterrestrial culture - is formulated, in books of logic, as first three rules arising (life/death, number of offspring matters and "there is mutation in each generation-shift") and then a forth rule arising (power, with viruses). This story - which in our course begins from a first reproducing shape and ends with finessing the anatomy of power in men - is visualizable like the caveman story-telling narratives we evolved to hear/see. We can proof-check its validity/possibility by following the narrative visually. The visual nature of evolution is in stark contrast to the purely linguistic/abstract nature of the existential theory.
Speaking o
f "abstract" descriptions i.e. d
escriptions that make it very clear to us that our understanding of the universe is a mere map (a reference) and not reality itself (mind you of PlatoÂ´s or KantÂ´s cave-metaphor and "the thing is not the thing itself" -philosophies)... The size-range of energymasspacetime,
at the size of quantum physics
has us describe photons etc using both the wave-description which focu
s
es on lengths of space (this is the "spacetime description") AND - in wave-particle duality - the energymass description that the energy of a photon is its color. Color (as perceived through the eyes), wave/spacetime-description and particle-energy/energymass-description all are valid descriptors of quantum particles. This ability of ours to describe any mass/phenomenon using both energymass- and spacetime-descriptions runs throughout the entire size-range. You can imagine two lines - one representing energymass and the other representing spacetime - running vertically through the pictures on the size-axis. Adding complexity to this, there is likewise two lines - gravity and electromagnetism - both running through the size-axis, gravity having itÂ´s duality of energymass and spacetime descriptions and electromagnetism too having both, in every level of the size-range, energymass and spacetime descriptions. Gravity is both Newtonian "masses pulling toward masses" (energymassÂ´ focus on mass) and Einsteinian "curvature of spacetime" (spacetimeÂ´s focus on space) - both descriptors are accurate.
We are half-way in a planetÂ´s history â€“ 4.5 billion years have passed and 5 billion remain. The theory you now know is, in other words, in cosmic majority â€“ more planets have it than not (if it takes approximately half of a planetÂ´s history to invent it and if it remains true for the rest of the planetÂ´s history). Most other planets i.e. the majority of extraterrestrials are ideological adherents of the theory. Spread this theory to get approval of the majority even though it lives light-years away. Currently 99.9% of the worldÂ´s population lives in the era of religions â€“ spread this theory to end religious wars and terrorism like 9/11. The world-view (the view/diagrams that explain the world) is the same in the cosmic majority.
IÂ´ve worked 10 years to invent this theory and as alone bearing it itÂ´s my responsibility that it spreads. The future civilization in which everyone has the same world-view thus is dependent on me. I feel a
unique ability to influence earthÂ´s future.
You, as one who has partaken of this rare knowledge, should also feel a responsibility about spreading it to change the world.
IÂ´ve talked about the emotional repertoire in the brain-diagram. If we were to genetically engineer (DNA-manipulate) a next generation, we would A) give it an incredible sense of humor and knowledge so it could entertain us, and/or B) make it a super-happy retard â€“ retarded because positive emotions donÂ´t motivate â€“ they pacify â€“ so super-happy is equal to looking like a mongoloid; needs and wants and everything that drives us is painful â€“ pain motivates while super-happiness pacifies. We would, by creating these DNA-engineered emotional repertoires (to accomplish the dual goal of incredible happiness and incredible entertainers/comedians/philosophers), be doing something that is done on other planets â€“ these are universal engineering goals. I need money to accomplish this project. If you wish to contribute, contact yonis1@gmail.com
You know that gold plate we sent up into space for aliens to find? It had etched on it images of man, some music, some other picturesâ€¦ We didnÂ´t send up the diagram discussed in this book. If the aliens see the gold plate we did send up, theyÂ´ll read between the lines â€“ seeing that there is no universal diagram â€“ and conclude that: â€œon earth they still believe in godsâ€.
You know how most people dedicate a large part of their lives to religion? Once they understand my tattoo (diagram) theyÂ´ll ask themselves: â€œwhat the hell have I been praying to?â€ It resembles a tiny needle popping a big balloon.
If this book goes mainstream, the future becomes so interesting that one forgets oneÂ´s everyday problems.
Interesting important things relieve
anxiety
(especially when they contain humor like a universal tattoo).
Nazis were friends with Nazis, communists were friends with communists, USA was friends with USA, when jihadists meet they share the same ideology and thus bond quickly. My
theory/ideology/religion-replacer is empathy-increasing.
The more things people agree upon the better.
In the diagram/tattoo there are about 16 â€œlinesâ€ (hundreds if we consider the emotional repertoire being drawn the same on other planets). The sport is to draw as many universal lines as possible â€“ drawn from science so they can be drawn from science anywhere in the infinite universe.
God is a war-motivator. They say â€œthere are no atheists in trenchholesâ€. You need a bit of God to do war.
ItÂ´s hard to be an atheist warrior. My book, by disproving god, thus makes motivation for war less.
Gods contribute nothing â€“ one will have the full human experience-repertoire without gods.
Rather no direction than the wrong direction â€“ gods only contribute to war; itÂ´s better to be tolerantly caveman, uncaring of ideologies/world-views, than to be religious.
It seems mean to say that â€œitÂ´s their fault that religious wars keep on going â€“ those that wonÂ´t studyâ€, but itÂ´s good marketing.
Accomplices.
From having read this book, the following should now be understandable:
Certain truth leads to the conclusion â€œdistinctionâ€, and simultaneously warrants an anti-distinction defined as â€œthat of which all is partâ€. The opposition between distinction and anti-distinction â€“ despite â€œrepresentationâ€ being ubiquitous (infinitely vaguely defined) â€“ together with the â€œmax size?â€-question asked in anti-distinction â€“ supports the fact that reality i.e. size-time is infinite. This then becomes our pillar in our existential theory that moves God away from a creator role. The two other pillars are energimasspacetime (found in E=mc
2
) and the opposition that we live in a singular reality yet see multiple things. From the middle of the known size-range (which itself is part of the infinite size-range) comes the tip of a triangle which symbolizes evolution. From evolution, then, comes the brain diagram with dopamine & serotonin across the visual and linguistic brainhalves, and a lower box which is our 3-category emotional repertoire; the most common 4 emotions in our idle society being power-hungryness (how to elevate oneself in the socioeconomic hierarchy if one is a man; and for females itÂ´s mapping the status-hierarchy of men in their social group as to find them differently attractive), expanding oneÂ´s world-view, planning sex and planning resource-gathering/work.
This makes for a multi-symbol diagram involving the existential theoryÂ´s three pillars holding up the square-triangle-brain (size-time-diagram, evolution, brain) diagram.
Certain truth is or leads to distinction, which itself â€“ as all distinct things are â€“ is part of anti-distinction.
This is like saying obvious things about the reality/everyday world in front of us: such as that size is infinite and that it is something in nothing. All this, in turn, leads us to draw a square: a size-time diagram with infinity-symbols in all 4 corners. From the middle of the known size-range,
then, comes a triangle â€“ evolution â€“ which ends up in the brain with serotonine, dopamine, two brainhalves, a cortex and an emotional repertoire (upper- and lower box). In the emotional repertoire there are 4 idle emotions, among them â€œseeking powerâ€ â€“ power here is defined as outcompeting other males (if oneself is male) in a status competition, but the principle of diminishing other malesÂ´ reproductive capabilities happened at several stages in evolution: males fighting males (growing bigger to become dinosaurs) or viruses hijacking reproductive mechanisms of single-celled organisms.
The search for power thus has led to brain-size growing (when competing for upwardness in hierarchies) but also things like T-rexÂ´s claws or the 1918 flu â€“ not to mention war.
Previous atheists have moved God from a place where do intervenes in everyday life using miracles, to a God that set everything in motion but then doesnÂ´t intervene. My philosophy places God as a bum who watches a skyscraper get built â€“ the bum then gets praised for the skyscraper getting built even though the bum didnÂ´t contribute anything: at most he watched as other mechanisms got everything done. Or God is a football fan who cheers at the players but doesnÂ´t himself contribute to making goals. Natural mechanisms create the world â€“ no need to praise God.
This book is worth you reading if it solves (or significantly helps) a major problem.
It is good marketing of my book to outline
the problem that I solve here.
USA is better than war, right? USA has poor folks committing crime â€“ thatÂ´s far better than nations waring. I move the problem from a macro-scale where nations fight eachother over oil, to an individualistic/family-based/friendship-based micro-scale where everyone feels as ideological/religious comrades â€“ empathy and friendship-buildingly sharing the knowledge of this book. I can get everyone to have the same ideology/religion-replacement so that thereÂ´ll be no war over the oil that has made us rich enough to not witness babies dying every day. Nations, races, ideologies, religions â€“ large groups â€“ makes the difference between war and crime. I solve the problems of macro-war and the friendship problem once everyone knows my diagrams. The post-oil decline isnÂ´t going to be pretty but we can take all measures to alleviate it â€“ spread this book.
If God is defined as â€œthe reason for existenceâ€ and I present a complete existential theory as a diagram, and I tattoo the diagram on my arm, is my arm then God? No, just a symbol for the reason for existence. One can tattoo an explanatory model for existence and God has during thousands of years been defined as the cause for existence.

Du vet med sÃ¤kerhet att du tÃ¤nker och att du existerar eftersom om du skulle bliva lurad av en allsmÃ¤ktig demon som fÃ¶rsÃ¶ker lura dig i allt du kan bli lurad i, sÃ¥ Ã¤r lurendrejeriet i sig en tanke-process och dÃ¤rfÃ¶r vet du att tankar existerar (du tÃ¤nker). FÃ¶r att du ska bli lurad sÃ¥ mÃ¥ste du existera och dÃ¤rfÃ¶r vet du â€jag existerarâ€. Att bli lurad Ã¤r en tankeprocess och tÃ¤nkaren Ã¤r nÃ¶dvÃ¤ndig fÃ¶r att det ska finnas nÃ¥gon som blir lurad. SÃ¥ du vet: oavsett vad sÃ¥ tÃ¤nker du och existerar du. Ã…vanstÃ¥ende Ã¤r tvÃ¥ saker, eller hur? De Ã¤r bÃ¥da del av samma hjÃ¤rna och samma tankeprocess kan bli ens analytiska verktygssats/tÃ¤nkare, men vi erkÃ¤nner Ã¤ndÃ¥ att det finns distinkta entiteter â€“ att det finns distinktion. Detta kan ocksÃ¥ kallas separation. Vad Ã¤r distinktions motsats, anti-distinktion? Det Ã¤r en verklighet; det som allt Ã¤r del av; den Ã¤r en och dess definition i ordboken Ã¤r att allt Ã¤r del av den. Om vi skriver distinktion (tÃ¤nkare och tanke) pÃ¥ vÃ¤nster sida av ett papper och anti-distinktion (verkligheten; det som allt Ã¤r del av; en) pÃ¥ hÃ¶ger sida av pappret â€“ kan den vÃ¤nstra sidan se den hÃ¶gra sidan? Nej, fÃ¶r att oppositionen mellan distinktion och anti-distinktion. Det finns alltid en observerare (tÃ¤nkaren) och dÃ¤rmed distinktion i varje observation och dÃ¤rmed kan anti-distinktion ej representeras/ses.
HjÃ¤rnan evolverade fÃ¶r att hantera naturliga fenomen â€“ det fanns aldrig ett scenario i historien dÃ¥ nÃ¥gonting osynligt behÃ¶vde hanteras och betÃ¤nkas. DÃ¤rfÃ¶r antar vi att tanke-processen blev fel nÃ¤r vi sÃ¤ger att distinktion/vi inte kan se anti-distinktion/verkligheten. Men tankeprocessen gick inte fel: allt det betyder Ã¤r att det finns mer till verkligheten Ã¤n kan representeras. Oavsett hur vagt â€representerasâ€ Ã¤r definierat, lÃ¥t oss sÃ¤ga att en kaffekopp â€“ oavsett om hjÃ¤rnor Ã¤r involverade eller inte â€“ antas fÃ¶rsÃ¶ka representera det som allt Ã¤r del av, dÃ¥ gÃ¶r anti-distinktions-distinktions-oppositionen (motsÃ¤ttningen mellan distinktion och dess motsats) att representationen Ã¤r inkorrekt. Vi kan frÃ¥ga om en anti-distinkt â€sakâ€ har en maximumstorlek och dÃ¤rmed distinktion? Nej. PÃ¥ samma not Ã¤r ett annat bevis fÃ¶r att storleksskalan Ã¤r oÃ¤ndlig Ã¤r att vi ser nÃ¥gonting (vÃ¥r vardagsvÃ¤rld) samt kan gÃ¶ra hypoteser ad infinitum, och Ã¤ndÃ¥ representerar ingenting ALL verklighet. Verkligheten dvs storlek-tid Ã¤r dÃ¤rfÃ¶r oÃ¤ndligt.
En oÃ¤ndlig storleksskala Ã¤r en av pelarna i den existentiella teorin. En annan pelare Ã¤r att energimassa och rumtid Ã¤r motsatser (opposition) men sammanflÃ¤tade sÃ¥som i E=mc
2
(dÃ¤r c
2
hÃ¤nvisar till en hastighet dvs rum Ã¶ver tid: rumtid). Multiplikationen sammanfÃ¶r energimassa tillsammans med rumtid; ingenting tillsammans med nÃ¥gonting/allting; existens tillsammans med icke-existens. VarfÃ¶r finns det existens i form av min kropp? Utan att gÃ¥ in i det historiska svaret sÃ¥ kan man fÃ¶rklara det genom att sÃ¤ga att kroppen Ã¤r nÃ¥gonting i (sammanflÃ¤tat med) ingenting, av en storlek i en oÃ¤ndlig storleks-skala (dÃ¤r relationen mellan vilka tvÃ¥ storlekar som helst (eller objekt av tvÃ¥ storlekar) Ã¤r att de Ã¤r fÃ¶rklaringen till varandra dvs rÃ¤ttfÃ¤rdigar varandra. Sedan finns det ocksÃ¥, som tredje pelare, distinktions-anti-distinktions-opposition dvs vi lever i en singular (ej plural) verklighet men ser distinkta/separata entiteter sÃ¥som tÃ¤nkare och tanke.
PÃ¥ tal om rumtid, rumtid Ã¤r den logiska startpunkten fÃ¶r den tidsbaserade existentiella teorin. Ingenting (tom rumtid) behÃ¶ver inget inledande/tidigare rÃ¤ttfÃ¤rdigande eller anledning att existera, fÃ¶r att det existerar inte. I den, hursomhelst, Ã¤r naturlagarna sanna dvs den Ã¤r inte irrationell / anti-logisk, och bland naturlagarna finns de som, inklusive E=mc
2
, som nÃ¤mner energimassa. Skulle energimassa kunna â€nÃ¤mnasâ€ utan att det skulle existera? Om â€jaâ€ sÃ¥ skulle det vara absurt / anti-logiskt. VarfÃ¶r skulle verkligheten nÃ¤mna saker som aldrig existerar? Eftersom naturlagarna Ã¤r strikta och tack vare vÃ¥r regel â€det som nÃ¤mns mÃ¥ste existera eller uppstÃ¥â€ sÃ¥ fÃ¥r vi, varÃ¤n (i de minsta storlekarna) dÃ¤r E=mc
2
nÃ¤mns, sÃ¥ finns existens och dÃ¤rfÃ¶r en tÃ¤t big bang. Faktumet att galaxer rusar ivÃ¤g accelererandes frÃ¥n varandra leder till ingenting (tom rymd) i framtiden, och med mellanhanden â€naturlagarâ€ sÃ¥ uppstÃ¥r energimassa igen sÃ¥ tÃ¤t som den kan vara. Ingen tids-delay mellan ingenting â€“ naturlagar â€“ energimassa men sÃ¥ snart en begrÃ¤nsad (av event-horizons som bestÃ¤ms av ljuset Ã¤ndliga hastighet) region blir ingenting/tomrum, sÃ¥ uppstÃ¥r en big bang som sedan genom kosmisk expansion blir ingenting igen, som sedan blir tomrum och en ny big bang igen. Detta Ã¤r den tidsmÃ¤ssiga beskrivningen om varfÃ¶r energimassa (som existerar sammanflÃ¤tad med rumtid sÃ¥som i E=mc
2
) bÃ¶rjar tÃ¤t och blir ingenting, och sedan repetitation.
Det Ã¥vanstÃ¥ende Ã¤r en rivalteori till â€Gud skapade jorden pÃ¥ 6 dagar och vilade pÃ¥ den sjundeâ€. Den Ã¤r inte intuitiv eftersom den har att gÃ¶ra med saker som vi inte hade att gÃ¶ra med under evolutionen: osynliga energimassarumtid/verkligheten/anti-distinktion som del av vÃ¥rt resonemang. Den har ocksÃ¥ en multi-anledning orsak fÃ¶r vÃ¥r existens: en tidsvis rationale involverandes bÃ¶rjan och slutet pÃ¥ big bang, kombinerad med en 3-pelares existentiell teori som rÃ¤ttfÃ¤rdigar storlek och energimassa. Den Ã¤r abstrakt/vetenskaplig men kan inte reduceras till simplare termer. Det Ã¤r den minsta gemensamma nÃ¤mnaren som alla kan tro pÃ¥ (oavsett religion).
Hur vagt har verkligheten definerat â€att representeraâ€?
OÃ¤ndligt vagt â€“ vad som helst kan representera vad som helst.
Ã„r representationen/representÃ¶ren verkligheten eller Allah?
Nej.
Kan nÃ¥gonting representera det som allt Ã¤r del av?
Nej.
DÃ¥ Ã¤r storleks-tids-diagrammet oÃ¤ndligt dvs inget representerar verkligheten. Hur mÃ¥nga Ã¤r den? Hur mÃ¥nga Ã¤r Allah? 1.
Sa denâ€¦, eller skrev den en bok?
Detta motbevisar att Allah skrev en bok.
Igen: hur mycket av verkligheten kan representeras av, sÃ¤g, en mÃ¥lning? All den?
Nej, hela verkligheten kan ej representeras. Precis som Allah inte kan fÃ¥ngas i ett ord/en bild.
Vi kan ha hypoteser â€“ hur mÃ¥nga hypoteser kan vi ha?
Om verkligheten Ã¤r storlekar och tider, energimassa och rumtid sÃ¥ Ã¤r det rektangulÃ¤ra storleks-tids-diagrammet med energimassarumtid i varje koordinat det universella sÃ¤ttet att representera allt som finns att representera.
Skriver den bÃ¶cker? Nej, den Ã¤r inte av fÃ¶rfattarnatur.
â€Gud sa till Muhammed ord fÃ¶r ordâ€¦â€ Ã¤r alltsÃ¥ ett falskt eller som mest ett metaforiskt pÃ¥stÃ¥ende.
â€Du mÃ¥ste gÃ¶ra ritualer fÃ¶r att inte hamna i helvetet, och i himmelen fÃ¥r du 72 oskulderâ€ Ã¤r med samma logik ocksÃ¥ ett falskt pÃ¥stÃ¥ende.
Det finns tre alternativ som fundament fÃ¶r denna logik â€“ kan du tÃ¤nka ut ett fjÃ¤rde?
1: Verkligheten Ã¤r ett synonym fÃ¶r Allah,
2: eller sÃ¥ finns inte Allah
3: eller sÃ¥ finns 72 oskulder (ej ett alternativ eftersom verkligheten inte Ã¤r av den naturen, dÃ¥ den Ã¤r storleks-tids-energimassarumtid, att den skriver bÃ¶cker).
Som tillÃ¤gg till det rektangulÃ¤ra storleks-tids-diagrammet med oÃ¤ndlighetssymboler i varje hÃ¶rn, och den evolutionÃ¤ra triangeln som representerar att livet blev mer komplext ju mer tiden gick (triangelns spets har sitt ursprung i mittersta storleken i den kÃ¤nda storleksskalan), finns fÃ¶ljande hjÃ¤rn-diagram:
Den existentiella teorin med dess tre pelare, dvs en oÃ¤ndlig storleksskala, energimassarumtid och distinktions-anti-distinktions-opposition, fÃ¶rutsÃ¤ger att det borde finnas en liten bit DNA som kopierar sig.
Evolutionsteorin bÃ¶rjar med den fÃ¶rsta reproducerande formen. Det var en form som samlande kringliggande massa till en liknande form. Den existentiella teorin fÃ¶rutsÃ¤ger existensen av oÃ¤ndligt mÃ¥nga sÃ¥dana former. Det som oundvikligen blir sant nÃ¤r man har reproduktion Ã¤r att vissa dÃ¶r medan andra Ã¶verlever (liv och dÃ¶d), att antalet avkomma/kopior formen gÃ¶r har betydelse och att det finns mutationer Ã¶ver tid. FÃ¶ljande Ã¤r sant om formens avkomma: vissa dÃ¶r medan andra Ã¶verlever, antalet avkomma har betydelse och avkomman Ã¤r annorlunda frÃ¥n originalformen. Dessa tre regler / naturlagar var inaktiva innan den fÃ¶rsta reproduktionen skedde. NÃ¤sta stora steg var nÃ¤r ett av dessa former mÃ¶jliggjorde fÃ¶r sig sjÃ¤lv att injicera sitt DNA in i andra formers reproduktiva mekanism, vilket utnyttjade princip nr 2: att antalet avkomma har betydelse. Det var det fÃ¶rsta viruset: den hijackade andras reproduktion. Regeln / naturlagen som kom i spel i.om. denna hÃ¤ndelse var att â€maktâ€ har betydelse: att hijacka andras reproduktiva mekanism ger evolutionÃ¤ra fÃ¶rdelar. Nu har vi lagt fram de fyra huvudregelerna som Ã¤r evolutionsteori: fÃ¶rst kom de tre fÃ¶rsta reglerna, sedan kom den fjÃ¤rde: makt. NÃ¤sta stora hÃ¤ndelse â€“ fÃ¶r att skydda mot att virus hijackar alla reproduktiva system â€“ var att ett immunsystem evolverade fÃ¶r att skydda mot virus hijacks-fÃ¶rsÃ¶k. Detta behÃ¶vde multicellulÃ¤rism. Precis som immunsystem krÃ¤ver multicellularism, sÃ¥ behÃ¶ver immunsystem multikÃ¶nadhet: fÃ¶r att vinna i kampen dÃ¤r virus muterar fÃ¶r att kringgÃ¥ immunsystem sÃ¥ behÃ¶ver immunsystemet ocksÃ¥ maximalt med mutation. Att mixa gener frÃ¥n tvÃ¥ kÃ¶n skapar ett mer muterat immunsystem, vilket hÃ¥ller ut i kampen mot virus dÃ¤r virus â€fÃ¶rsÃ¶kerâ€ mutera sig runt immunsystemet. Den nÃ¤sta stora hÃ¤ndelsen var att en av dessa multicellulÃ¤ra organismer â€“ en fisk eller mask â€“ av det manliga kÃ¶net muterade till att vara agressiv och fÃ¶rinta andra manliga varelser. Han skulle ha fÃ¥tt hÃ¶gre tillgÃ¥ng till kvinnliga organismer jÃ¤mfÃ¶rt med hans icke-agressiva likar. Detta kan ocksÃ¥ kallas â€maktâ€ eftersom agressiva hanar hijackar andra hanars tillgÃ¥ng till kvinnor genom att dÃ¶da hanarna. Detta orsakar dinosaurierna eftersom stÃ¶rre muskelmassa och skarpare vapen Ã¤r bÃ¤ttre pÃ¥ att dÃ¶da rivalerna. Bland dinosaurierna fanns moder-avkomma-bandet, ditplacerad av evolutionen eftersom det var en fÃ¶rdel fÃ¶r mÃ¶drar att se sina barn Ã¶verleva till vuxenskap. Detta band muterade till att involvera flock-medlemmar eftersom en grupp sammarbetandes bÃ¤ttre kan vinna Ã¶ver individualister i brÃ¥k om vad som helst. NÃ¤sta stora steg var att nÃ¥gon kartlade flocken, i sin hjÃ¤rna, som en hierarki (upp-ned-axeln) med en lÃ¤ngtan efter att stÃ¥ hÃ¶gst upp i hierarkin. Denna kapitalistiska tÃ¤vlan mot toppen gjorde att hjÃ¤rnan vÃ¤xte sig stÃ¶rre â€“ stÃ¶rre minnesbank, mer detaljrika fÃ¶rutsÃ¤gelser och snabbare planering Ã¤r alla fÃ¶rdelar som kommer frÃ¥n att ha ett stÃ¶rre kortex.
Du har en komposit-sÃ¤ker sanning bestÃ¥endes av tvÃ¥ sÃ¤kra sanningar: du kan med sÃ¤kerhet sÃ¤ga att du tÃ¤nker (fÃ¶r att om du skulle bli lurad: att bli lurad Ã¤r en tankeprocess) och att du existerar (eftersom att bli lurad krÃ¤ver den som blir lurad). Jag tÃ¤nker och jag finns Ã¤r ett pÃ¥stÃ¥ende men tvÃ¥ sanningar. Du kan med sÃ¤kerhet pÃ¥stÃ¥ dig ha â€distinktionâ€ eftersom du har att gÃ¶ra med multipla separata entiteter (sÃ¥som â€jagâ€ och â€tankarâ€). Man kan sÃ¤ga, nÃ¤r man ser den sÃ¤kra sanningens â€jag tÃ¤nkerâ€ och â€jag existerarâ€, att avstÃ¥endet/mellanrummet mellan de tvÃ¥ idÃ©erna (tÃ¤nkare och tanke) Ã¤r distinktion. AvstÃ¥endet/mellanrummet som separarar tÃ¤nkare frÃ¥n tanke Ã¤r nÃ¶dvÃ¤ndigt fÃ¶r â€disktinktionâ€ att hÃ¤rledas som sÃ¤ker sanning fÃ¶ljandes ur nÃ¤sta logiska steg, med ursprunget av den originella primÃ¤ra sÃ¤kra sanningen.
Ã„r alla distinkta entiteter del av en singulÃ¤r verklighet om â€verklighetenâ€ Ã¤r definierad som â€det som allt Ã¤r del avâ€? Med andra ord: om vi ritar distinktion pÃ¥ vÃ¤nster sida av ett papper och anti-distinktion (distinktionÂ´s motsats: en ensam verklighet â€“ det som allt Ã¤r del av. Zoomandes ut maximalt) pÃ¥ hÃ¶ger sida av pappret, kan dÃ¥ distinktion representera hÃ¶ger sida av pappret dvs anti-distinktion? Hur skulle nÃ¥gon distinkt entitet kunna vara/representera motsatsen till vad representation/distinktion Ã¤r? Vilken representation som helst av anti-distinktion/verkligheten mÃ¥ste ha minst tre entiteter: tÃ¤nkare, mellanrummet mellan tÃ¤nkare och tanke, och tanke.
Separation/distinktion Ã¤r antaget i representation, vilket innebÃ¤r att anti-distinktion Ã¤r orepreserbart.
Hur vagt har universum/Gud definerat vad en representation Ã¤r dvs nÃ¤r en representation sker? VÃ¥ra hjÃ¤rnor anvÃ¤nder neuroner fÃ¶r att representera, men vad sÃ¤gs om â€“ istÃ¤llet fÃ¶r neuroner (oavsett om hjÃ¤rnor Ã¤r inblandade eller inte) â€“ universum lÃ¥ter vilket slumpmÃ¤ssigt valt objekt som helst lÃ¥ta sig sÃ¤gas, sÃ¥som neuroner sÃ¤gs, representera verkligheten? Universum har definierat â€representationâ€ oÃ¤ndligt vagt dvs uteslutandes hjÃ¤rnor sÃ¥ kan vilket slumpmÃ¤ssigt objekt som helst spotant bli/vara symbolen fÃ¶r all verklighet â€“ fÃ¶r att universum har definierat â€representeraâ€ oÃ¤ndligt vagt. Trots den oÃ¤ndligt vaga definitionen av vad som representerar vad, sÃ¥ gÃ¶r distinktions-anti-distinktions-oppositionen (linjen som separerar vÃ¤nster sida av pappret frÃ¥n hÃ¶ger sida; motsÃ¤ttningen mellan distinktion och anti-distinktion) att verkligheten Ã¤r orepresenterbar. Om verkligheten Ã¤r anti-distinktion dÃ¥ finns ingen distinktion (representation Ã¤r oundvikligen distinktion), trots universums oÃ¤ndligt vaga definition av â€representeraâ€, fÃ¥nga verkligheten. I representationer kan vi rÃ¤kna minst tre saker och det vi fÃ¶rsÃ¶ker representera Ã¤r en sak utan nÃ¥gonting utanfÃ¶r den. Faktumet att representationer innehÃ¥ller distinktion gÃ¶r att att fÃ¥nga verkligheten (allt som ett) omÃ¶jligt.
Vi kan ha oÃ¤ndligt mÃ¥nga eller oÃ¤ndligt innehÃ¥llsfulla/stora representationer/hypoteser â€“ sÃ¥som ett oÃ¤ndligt storleks-tids-diagram â€“ och genom att abstrakt peka till verkligheten, sÃ¥ gÃ¶r universums regel att ingenting representerar verkligheten trots universums oÃ¤ndligt vaga definition av â€representeraâ€ av oÃ¤ndligt mycket, gÃ¶r verkligheten orepresenterbar. Detta kan bara betyda en sak: verkligheten â€“ som vi kÃ¤nner som storlekar och tider (ett storleks-tids-diagram) â€“ Ã¤r oÃ¤ndligt. Det finns oÃ¤ndligt stort och oÃ¤ndligt litet med oÃ¤ndligt mycket dÃ¥tid och oÃ¤ndligt mycket framtid. Detta rektangulÃ¤ra storleks-tids-diagram dvs vÃ¥r vardagsvÃ¤rld av storlek-tid har oÃ¤ndligheter Ã¶verallt.
Energimassa i rumtid: ett i noll, existens i icke-existens, nÃ¥gonting i ingenting â€“ sÃ¥som definierats av E=mc
2
dÃ¤r c
2
stÃ¥r fÃ¶r ljusets hastighet (rum Ã¶ver tid dvs rumtid/noll/icke-existens) och E=m refererar till energimassa (existens, nÃ¥gonting, allt).
Distinktions-anti-distinktions-opposition: vi lever i en singulÃ¤r verklighet men vi ser multipla objekt.
En oÃ¤ndlig storleksskala.
De Ã¥vanstÃ¥ende tre idÃ©erna Ã¤r en existentiell teori (en teori som fÃ¶rklarar existensen av en reproduktiv form dvs evolutions bÃ¶rjan dvs vÃ¥r existens). Det Ã¤r modernt att anvÃ¤nda sig av tre likvÃ¤rdiga idÃ©er fÃ¶r att fÃ¶rklara ens existens â€“ alla tidigare existentiella teorier har antingen anvÃ¤nt en enda idÃ© (monoteism) eller en saga/myt (mÃ¥nga vardagliga (ej vetenskapliga/abstrakta) idÃ©er) fÃ¶r att fÃ¶rklara existens.
Den fÃ¶rutsÃ¤gande kvalitÃ©n som gÃ¶r denna existentiella teori till en vetenskaplig teori Ã¤r att den, baserat pÃ¥ en oÃ¤ndlig storleksskala av energimassarumtid och distinktions-anti-distinktions-opposition, fÃ¶rutsÃ¤ger att det i en oÃ¤ndlig storleksskala borde finnas en storlek dÃ¤r reproduktion (DNA) sker. Den existentiella teorin fÃ¶rutsÃ¤ger det fÃ¶rsta DNA:t, och frÃ¥n det fÃ¥r vi evolutionÃ¤r teori.
En annan fÃ¶rutsÃ¤gande kvalitÃ© Ã¤r att teorin fÃ¶rutsÃ¤ger att big bang borde varit
tÃ¤t
. A-priori begynnelsen av universum Ã¤r logiskt sett tomhet eftersom tomhet inte behÃ¶ver nÃ¥gon tidigare/fÃ¶religgande logiskt rÃ¤ttfÃ¤rdigande eftersom det ej existerar. I tom rumtid Ã¤r naturlagarna sanna, sÃ¥som naturlagarna som hanterar energimassa (sÃ¥som E=mc
2
), och dÃ¤rfÃ¶r bÃ¶rjar big bang oÃ¤ndligt tÃ¤t â€“ fÃ¶r att E=mc
2
Ã¤r lika sann samtidigt i de minsta storlekarna. De minsta tomma rymderna hade E=mc
2
som sann inom sig direkt nÃ¤r det fanns ingenting, vilket fÃ¶rutsÃ¤ger en tÃ¤t big bang. En region, inom event horizons gjorda av energimassa rusandes ivÃ¤g i >c (pga mÃ¶rk energi accelererandes kosmisk expansion) Ã¤r per definition â€ingentingâ€ i vilket E=mc
2
Ã¤r sann i de minsta utrymmena, vilket Ã¥stadkommer en big bang utom rÃ¤ckhÃ¥ll fÃ¶r de nÃ¤rmaste ( v = >c) energimassa. Ingenting (utom rÃ¤ckhÃ¥ll fÃ¶r nÃ¤rmaste energimassa fÃ¶r att den Ã¤r pÃ¥ vÃ¤g bortÃ¥t i >c) orsakas i centrumpunkten som har event horizons som grÃ¤ns lÃ¤ngst bort, vilket leder till en big bang (eftersom naturlagarna uppbringar energimassa i det tomma centrumet).
Det Ã¤r en stor historisk hÃ¤ndelse att det Ã¤ntligen finns ett ateistiskt argument i form av en universitetskurs: det Ã¤r en existentiell teori plus evolution som inte behÃ¶ver en personifierad gud fÃ¶r att fungera, utan dess pelare (oÃ¤ndlig storleksskala av energimassarumtid och distinktions-anti-distinktions-opposition) kan inte ha en personifierad gud tillagd till dem som en fjÃ¤rde pelare utan att teorin lÃ¥ter lÃ¶jlig. Det Ã¤r inte bara sÃ¥ att teorin inte behÃ¶ver en personifierad gud, utan att lÃ¤gga till en gud fÃ¶rstÃ¶r teorins minimalistiska rationellt kompletta skÃ¶nhet. Gudar fÃ¶rfular teorin. Teorins upptÃ¤ckt Ã¤r en stor historisk hÃ¤ndelse eftersom aldrig fÃ¶rr har en hel kurs (bÃ¶rjandes med sÃ¤ker sanning, gÃ¥endes genom den existentiella teorin och slutandes i evolution) lagts fram i ateismens intellektuella debatt, som ett argument mot en personifierad gud.
Anatomin i hjÃ¤rnan frÃ¥n att hÃ¶ra sÃ¤ker sanning (jag tÃ¤nker & jag finns) â€“ bÃ¶rjan av denna kurs â€“ skapar samma neuronala pathways / associationer mellan idÃ©er i varje person som hÃ¶r vet sÃ¤ker sanning. Det logiska steget till â€distinktionâ€ Ã¤r att notera, som meta-analys av den primÃ¤ra sÃ¤kra sanningen â€“ att man har mÃ¥nga idÃ©er (jag tÃ¤nker OCH jag finns) och att man kan ta den logiska vÃ¤gen till nÃ¤sta steg i kursen (distinktion finns). Att sedan motsÃ¤tta anti-distinktion med distinktion skapar den ofÃ¶rnimmbara â€“ â€mot resonâ€ (eftersom logik Ã¤r, i simpla mÃ¤nniskor, enbart visuell) â€“ slutsatsen att vi/distinktion inte kan se verkligheten/anti-distinktion. Distinktions-anti-distinktions-oppositionen Ã¤r svÃ¥rbegriplig fÃ¶r att den â€“ sÃ¥som formell logik eller matematik â€“ enbart anvÃ¤nder ord istÃ¤llet fÃ¶r bilder (den lingvistiska hjÃ¤rnhalvan istÃ¤llet fÃ¶r den visuella). Vi evolverade till att sÃ¤ga â€om jag kan se det sÃ¥ tror jag pÃ¥ detâ€ och det Ã¤r en god tumregel eftersom praktiska sekvenser hÃ¤ndelser kan verifieras som sanna eller osanna genom att visualisera dem. Men i denna filosofi: nej â€“ det mÃ¥ste vara lingvistiskt att vi fÃ¶rnekar oss sjÃ¤lva konceptet â€all verklighetâ€, vilket leder till slutsatsen att det finns mer till verkligheten Ã¤n nÃ¥gonting â€“ oavsett hur vagt universum definerat â€att representeraâ€ â€“ representerar. Detta tillÃ¤gger oÃ¤ndligt mÃ¥nga storlekar till vÃ¥r abstrakta stoorleksskala / storleks-tids-diagrammet; det gÃ¶r en rektangel (med storlek pÃ¥ y-axeln och tid pÃ¥ x-axeln) med oÃ¤ndlighetstecken i varje hÃ¶rn, som i sin tur blir en pelare i vÃ¥r personlig-gud-fÃ¶rnekande existentiella teori.
Att komma frÃ¥n sÃ¤ker sanningen genom enbart logiska steg (meta-analyser och motsÃ¤ttningsskapande av motsatser) till en existentiell teori som fÃ¶rutsÃ¤er evolutionen Ã¤r en stor historisk hÃ¤ndelse i ateismens historia.
I ett historiskt sammanhang Ã¤r anatomin (neurala anslutningar mellan idÃ©er och sekvenser logik) som skapas av denna kurs som ett paradigm-shifte in i en ny era av civilisation â€“ en era liknande den som finns pÃ¥ oÃ¤ndligt mÃ¥nga planeter vars vetenskap kommit lÃ¤ngre Ã¤n vÃ¥ra 4.5 miljarder Ã¥rs mittenpunkt i en vanlig vattenbÃ¤rande planets historia.
Evolution, genom att bÃ¶rja frÃ¥n â€en massa som samlar kringliggande massa till en liknande formâ€ kliver fram frÃ¥n den existentiella teorins oÃ¤ndliga storleksskala av energimassarumtid. Om vi antar att DNA Ã¤r replikationsmolekylen sÃ¥ kan vi ta steget till â€“ klivandes Ã¶ver hur cellvÃ¤ggar evolverade osv â€“ till att virus hijackar andras reproduktiva system. Detta â€“ i den universella inter-planetÃ¤ra rymdvarelsekulturen â€“ formuleras som, i bÃ¶cker av logik, som att de tre fÃ¶rsta reglerna uppkommer (liv/dÃ¶d, antalet avkomma har betydelse och â€det sker mutationer i varje generationsskifteâ€) och sedan att en fjÃ¤rde regel uppkommer (makt, med virus). Denna historia â€“ som i vÃ¥r kurs bÃ¶rjar frÃ¥n den fÃ¶rsta reproduktiva formen och slutar i att finslipa anatomin bakom makt i mÃ¤n â€“ Ã¤r visualiseringsbar som en grottmanna-historias narrativ likt dem vi evolverade till att se/hÃ¶ra. Vi kan proof-checka/validera historian genom att se den visuellt. Evolutions visuella natur Ã¤r i stark kontrast till den rent linguistiska/abstraka natur som den existentiella teorin har.
PÃ¥ tal om â€abstraktaâ€ beskrivningar dvs beskrivningar som gÃ¶r det vÃ¤ldigt klart fÃ¶r oss att vÃ¥r fÃ¶rstÃ¥else av universum bara Ã¤r en karta (en referens) och inte verkligheten i sig (tÃ¤nk pÃ¥ PlatoÂ´s och KantÂ´s grottmetafor och â€saken Ã¤r inte saken sjÃ¤lvâ€-filosofierâ€)â€¦ Storleksskalan av energimassarumtid, i storleken av kvantfysik har oss beskrivandes fotoner etc anvÃ¤ndandes bÃ¥de vÃ¥g-beskrivningar med fokus pÃ¥ lÃ¤ngder i rymd (dessa Ã¤r â€rumtids-beskrivningarâ€) OCH â€“ i vÃ¥r-partikel-dualitet â€“ energimassabeskrivningen dvs att energin i en foton Ã¤r dess fÃ¤rg. FÃ¤rg (sÃ¥som den uppfattas genom Ã¶gonen), vÃ¥g/rumtids-beskrivningen och partikel-energi/energimassa-beskrivningen Ã¤r alla legitimea beskrivningar av kvantfysiken. VÃ¥r fÃ¶rmÃ¥ga att beskriva vilken massa/vilket fenomen som helst med bÃ¥de energimassa- och rumtids-beskrivningar lÃ¶per genom hela storleksskalan. Du kan fÃ¶restÃ¤lla dig tvÃ¥ linjer â€“ en fÃ¶r energimassa och en fÃ¶r rumtid â€“ gÃ¥endes vertikalt genom alla bilder pÃ¥ storleks-axeln. TillÃ¤ggandes komplexitet pÃ¥ detta finns det tvÃ¥ linjer till â€“ tyngdlagen och elektromagnetism â€“ bÃ¥da gÃ¥endes lÃ¤ngs storleks-axeln, tyngdlagen har dess dualitet av energimassa- och rumtids-beskrivningar och elektromagnetism likasÃ¥ har desamma, dvs energimassa och rumtidsbeskrivningar. Tyngdlagen Ã¤r bÃ¥de Newtonisk â€massor dras till massorâ€ (energimassas fokus pÃ¥ massa) och Einsteinsk â€rumtids krÃ¶kningâ€ (rumtids fokus pÃ¥ rum) â€“ bÃ¥da beskrivningar Ã¤r korrekta.
Vi Ã¤r halvvÃ¤gs igenom en planets historia â€“ 4.5 miljarder Ã¥r har gÃ¥tt och 5 miljarder Ã¥terstÃ¥r. Teorin som du nu vet Ã¤r m.a.o. i kosmisk majoritet â€“ fler planeter har den Ã¤n har den inte (om det tar ungefÃ¤r hÃ¤lften av planetens historia att uppfinna den och om den kvarstÃ¥r under andra hÃ¤lften av planetens historia). De flesta andra planeter dvs majoriteten av rymdvarelser Ã¤r m.a.o. ideologiska anhÃ¤ngare av teorin. Sprid denna teori fÃ¶r att fÃ¥ bekrÃ¤ftelse av majoriteten trots att den bor ljusÃ¥r bort. Just nu lever 99.9% av jordens befolkning i eran av religioner â€“ sprid denna teori fÃ¶r att fÃ¥ slut pÃ¥ religiÃ¶sa krig samt terrorism sÃ¥som 9/11. VÃ¤rldsbilden (bilden/diagrammet som fÃ¶rklarar vÃ¤rlden) Ã¤r densamma i den kosmiska majoriteten.
Jag har jobbat i 10 Ã¥r fÃ¶r att Ã¥stadkomma teorin och som ensam om att kÃ¤nna till den Ã¤r det mitt ansvar att den sprids. Den framtida civilizationen i vilken alla har samma vÃ¤rldsbild hÃ¤nger dÃ¤rfÃ¶r pÃ¥ mig. Jag kÃ¤nner en unik mÃ¶jlighet att pÃ¥verka jordens framtid.

Can we
timetravel? We can proceed from era to era, just like dinosaurs preceded man and not vice versa â€“ its a universal sequence on any planet.
Heaven/karma instinctual but collides with main picture.
Water, primordial soup, proteins, dns strand. Single cell reproducing multiplying. Then 1 of these cells thought â€œill inject my own dna into some other cellâ€, hijack its reproductive system. Very beneficial. So first there were 3 rules: life n death, number of offspring matters and mutation in each generationshift, then with viruses came the 4th rule â€œpowerâ€ â€“ hijacking othersâ€™ reproductive system. Then theres an arms race between viruses and â€¦ â€œOur kind ofâ€ organism, so to mutate our immune system faster two genders arose. Then fights between males led to the dinosaurs. Then brains bonded into groups to fight individualists. Then capitalist power struggles within the group made the brain grow larger, weâ€™re good at planning and remembering things. Then we get to kingdoms. From the water puddle to the 21 st century. Those who proceed to the next era will live in a world where holy book-group bonds are weak and a universal courses group bond is the strongest, thus national wars or civilizational wars where identity is based on other than this science will be impossible. The planet has two future ways to go 60 years from now and one is better but needs some investment of time until everybody knows this course.
Theres a universal course/book thats on every advanced enough planet throughout the universe and at the regeneration of every universe. If you consider the entire corpus of human knowledge, youd find 3 rational starting points: certain truth, nothingness and that reality is one. Just like dinosaurs predate humans the first chapter with the 3 starting points predate the connecting of â€œi think n i exist, distinctionâ€ and â€œreality is one, antidistinction. Which leads to that there is more to reality than can be contemplated meaning that its infinite. Thats chaper 2: like multiplication and division are much higher levels of mathematics than adding and subtracting, chaper 2 is higher than the starting points in chapter 1.
â€”â€”â€”
If you want to be altruistic/selfless you can think about the millions of lives lost or living as refugees due to religious wars and group-loyalties based on ideology/religion. What if group-loyalty could be, for everyone, based on a single universal ideology? Then friendship ties, shared histories, well-mixing personalities and the like would form groups that donÂ´t have a religious mission/an ideological drive. When all ideologies are erased â€“ and religions too â€“ then simple biological mechanisms like common goals, shared interests and family ties bind us together â€“ and those kind of conglomerations are more likely to disintegrate than if there is a holy book or any ideological book as the binding principle between people. If ISIS would be educated then it would disintegrate and many civil wars break out among different families in Iraq/Syria â€“ but there would not be this major cleft between western&modern and holy&dogmatic.
If you want to be selfish like Ayn Rand: the upcoming world order / economy will be a meritocracy based on who advances or knows the most science. The ancient Chinese had a government where even the lowest peasant, if he passed a test in ConfusciousÂ´ teachings, could elevate himself higher in the society. Hierarchy is based on what is objectively to be admired; hierarchy is based on what infinitely many extraterrestrials in consensus have agreed upon be the criteria for how a humanÂ´s thoughts should be wired; hierarchy is based on the universeÂ´s disposition to reward those with the most accurate world-view or whom advance the pre-existing world-view and spread it to others â€“ the universe wants us choose to elevate in the hierarchy those whom appriciate the universe most fully, wholistically and most accurately. The old power-system based on money is upheld by banks and is based on present day humansÂ´ ties to the past. There will be an overlap between the old bank-based system for establishing VIP-status and the new economy which is a meritocracy based on science. If we want to be like planets ahead of us in the evolution of history, we ought to adapt the meritocracy-economy. After a few generations inherited money seems less legitimate than knowing or advancing science and by doing so wiring oneÂ´s cortex (flexible thinking part of the brain) as universally as possible (as much like the consensus among extraterrestrials is as possible).
There are three universal starting points for the universal course which will wire your brain universally. What I mean by â€œuniversalâ€ is that:
A) it is based on science meaning that it is retrievable from anywhere at any time; it is available universally unlike some time-specific language-specific location-specific holy-book-revalation.
B) universal means that it is how aliens/extraterrestrials sooner or later wire their brains. Sure: they can choose to live in a multi-worldviewical world but sooner or later the truth will conquer meaning that all various ideas among every tribe or nation will congregate (like a lens focuses many beams of light into one focal point) into a single set of ideas and prioritarizations â€“ a single world-view will emerge from the many. It is the identical world-view that all civilizing planets will congregate to/toward because science is universal. This congregating is as much of a universal step in evolution as that a planet with water will eventually have bacteria. Eventually everyone will know the course and the idea of this book. â€œWhat do you believe?â€ will no longer be a question because everyone has wired their cortexÂ´s ideas based on universal ideas/science.
â€”â€”â€“
Am I a muslim?
I have my size-time-diagram into which everything fits and this diagram being infinite gives an existential theory because:
â€“ sizes justify (are the cause of) one another, so thereÂ´s infinite justification.
â€“ time is infinite and our universe is observed to become nothingness in the future, and nothingness would be absurd if not for the fact that in the smallest spaces energymass is summoned because E=mc2 is a stable, constant law of nature.
â€“ there can only be separate distinct entities if distinction is counter-balanced and happens in non-distinction (a singular Reality). This point is much like the previous point of that only in nothingness can somethingness be summoned.
God, then, if we are to look for a meaning for the word, cannot be:
â€“ a specific object, size nor time within something infinitely larger
â€“ cannot, by definition, be apart from and â€œbeyondâ€ [that of which all is part] (Reality). Reality being an infinite size- and time-range of energymasspacetime is enough of an existential theory to explain us being here, the Big Bang, and the rest of the questions. God would, if claimed to be â€œbeyondâ€ the existential theory, be an unnecessary unproven assumption but more to the point: God would be â€œunrealâ€ if Reality is defined as we define it here. Such â€œbeyond Realityâ€-gods are unreal. WhatÂ´s more is that the phrase â€œAllah akbarâ€ (God is the biggest/greatest) wouldnÂ´t be true if Reality/[that of which all is part] is God plus Reality â€“ if [that of which all is part] has two major components, God and an energymasspacetime sizerange etc (the existential theory), then the sum of those two components is greater than God.
God, thus, obviously means Reallity by the definition of God being the greatest. God is then infinite. It makes sense to see people in awe over how much they can study, when they know thereÂ´s infinitely many fields of science which we do not have access to but which are logical and necessities for Reality to hold together. There being nothing absurd in an infinite size-range that resembles our known size-range (from quantum physics to the visible universe) is awesome and the highest you could possibly worship. This again proves that God is just a synonym for Reality/the existential theory.
Having studied all fields of science i.e. all sizes is the known sizerange, seeing how they all make up (justify) eachother (that itÂ´s just zooming in and zooming out), the wisdom that the sizerange is infinite (that there are infinitely many sizes making up one another) from the distinction (I think & I am logical path) and anti-distinction (that Reality is one) -thing, is the reason why we exist and God is not some size (sizes are not minds, except through evolution). Having studied all known sizes and knowing that the sizerange is infinite: it is an explanation to why weÂ´re here (akin to the Adam and Eve story or â€œGod created earth in 6 daysâ€ story) but it is not a revalation-giving thing â€“ the Quran wasnÂ´t written by God because God is not the kind of thing that writes/dictates stories. God being an infinite sizerange as thus our Creator is true, but the true way to get knowledge, rituals/pictoral representations and even guidance is through my work, not the work of the holy book-writers. The holy book writers might have said something true about God (just like I do in my work) â€“ but that is true of science textbooks moreso â€“ and they all said false things such as that God talks/gives revalations/authors holy books.
I can see the bronze-age marketing-teamÂ´s standpoint: people are more prone to follow dictates if theyÂ´re said to come from something/someone â€œhigher than humanâ€ i.e. a God or a ghost/spirit. Being invisible in as nonsense-a-way as some rituals are, is great for marketing. Everyone knows how humans thing â€“ theyÂ´re themselves human; we are only partly rational (a computer is rational) in what we think â€“ all our animal lusts bias or interrupt the thoughts that are as logical as they get, but theyÂ´re always going to be based against an evolutionary background just like the pitfall that my abstract diagram-including infinity-mentioning world-view is more like algebra than â€œwhat a world-view (context in which we are) should be thinking about that we lived for millions of years on the savannah, only needing to know (in oneÂ´s world-view) where the water-source is or whom stands under whom in the social hierarchy. WeÂ´ve mapped geographies, the use-based properties of objects/tools and personalities (and still do) for a gazillion years â€“ only with the advent of science SOME of us achieved higher i.e. used their evolved meager toolkit with all its biases to scetch out something like the theory of evolution in the 1800s. Looking at the evolution of [what we use our memory for]/how we map our surroundings/our world-view, before we mapped social relationships we mapped geographies. Before we mapped the functions of inventions (tools) our map only contained caveman tools (sharp stones and spears). The next step is to map oneÂ´s context as an infinite size-time-diagram (where size and time are really the same, but abstract thinking allows us to separate them into two distinct axises) or energymasspacetime (with itsÂ´ many laws of nature found in every school textbook in the world) and the distinction-antidistinction-
thing which feels so awkward/abstract that one wonders why one needs it as pillar 3 of the existential theory: the answer is: it wasnÂ´t invented (the words â€œI see a distinct objectâ€ or â€œwhy is there distinction?â€ werenÂ´t said in the same breath as â€œReality is oneâ€ or â€œenergymass and spacetime uniteâ€) until I did it in the 21st century). It might seem trivial to mention that separate entities exist in a singular Reality â€“ itÂ´s so obvious (thatÂ´s why no-one cared to make a big fuzz out of inventing it) but it makes the existential theory have three pillars (all of which can seem obvious) and not 4 â€“ thereÂ´s nothing more to add to the existential theory once youÂ´ve added the obvious â€œseparation in antidistinctionâ€-statement. I want to know how aliens (the infinitely many of them, steered by science toward an incommon path) think because its synonymous to finding a TRUE â€œkey to historyâ€ (Marx thought the key was equality, Hitler thought the key was racial superiority and a brutally competative relationship between races, Capitalism thinks itÂ´s freedom (less government), some might think they â€œkey to historyâ€ is to fund technological development). â€œHow aliens thinkâ€ is a shorthand way of saying â€œthe key to historyâ€ or â€œwhat will happen next/eventually and in hindsight seen as akin to the era of ancient grecoroman culture, the Industrial Revolution or the Digital revolution)â€. ItÂ´s what weÂ´re steered towards; itÂ´s the closest thing we get to divine guidance. ItÂ´s simply universal (drawn on science and practiced by infinitely many aliens) guidance/suggestions/
recommendations that we, as a species, can choose to promogate and thus â€œfollowâ€ or if weÂ´ll stick to multiculturalismÂ´s many -ismÂ´s like political quran-based islamism or christian-based â€œthe holy book gave me thisâ€-morality and codes of conduct. Some -ismÂ´s are dangerous (like quran-based politics and law) while some -ismÂ´s like christianity give too much credit to the -ism for simple human decency (in an age of extreme wealth globally). When my tummy is full IÂ´m a decent person â€“ I try to make money but IÂ´m not desparate after extreme wealth because I know that my caveman-brainÂ´s â€œneedâ€ for power (through status-symbols and freedom of space my environment to maximize the effectiveness of my hobby (writing)) wonÂ´t get satisfied no matter what external extravaganzas trigger my eyeballs, nor can people (socializing) make me much more satisfied than I am right now because all that is interesting and that there is to people is their brain â€“ and after a few weeks together thereÂ´ll be nothing I know nor any mental tool that I use that wonÂ´t, despite copyright, be in the hands of my friend: we wonÂ´t talk science (me teaching him/her) after all the science has been taught. I donÂ´t care to teach trivia so when I say â€œI teach SCIENCEâ€ I mean a finite thing: the existential theory plus something from each level of the known sizerange. Getting a P.hD from specializing on finding the structure of a rare protein only found in the feet of Amazonian forrest-mice is to put your eyes too close to the diagram; P.hDs for specializing/having a very narrow topic for oneÂ´s mind to engage in are for people who donÂ´t see the forest for the trees and care to rather look at one leaf of one tree instead of thinking about and seeing the forest as a whole. IÂ´m a forest person â€“ a leaf 10 cm from my eyes just bugs me. ThatÂ´s why there is a finite repertoire to what I call â€œscienceâ€ â€“ it takes a few days for me (my accomplishment/my work) to be fully understood and if repeated repetative. One only needs to know why/where one exists (the existential theory) once â€“ one canÂ´t forget it because we are made to remember the very context in which we live (here an evolutionary bias helps us: when someone explains â€œwhat the world isâ€ we remember it because â€œwhat the world wasâ€ in caveman days was the most useful thing the brain could do â€“ in fact we evolved such large brains because bigger brains remember better (can moreso map social relationships, successfull or unsuccesfull learning-experiences). We want to climb upwards in the hierarchy, find a mate, etc but all these wants and needs would be useless (theyÂ´d having nothing to work on) if it werenÂ´t for the map (of social relationships etc) that our brain is capable of remembering. We are inclined to remember existential theories because such knowledge about our place in the context was as useful as mapping whom is married to whom. This bias, by the way, is something holy book writers used to get people interested in their book. â€œGod created earth in 6 days (not 5)â€ is memorable because of our bias toward wanting to know about â€œcreation of the worldâ€ â€“ so the number â€œ6 daysâ€ is remembered too because it adds to the map that we then work on to seek power and other evolutionary benefits. ItÂ´s hard to make plans that have one reach evolutionary benefits if one does not know oneÂ´s environment/the external world. â€œ6 days for creating this place/worldâ€ adds to oneÂ´s map of the environment/place/external world. We have a bias for remembering it. Too bad the bronze-age holy books used this marketing trick (â€œhey, letÂ´s say something about their world (like the creation of it) because that would be something they remember!â€) to give pseudo- existential theories. The holy books made sales because not only do people want information about their context, people also want God to talk and interfere with day-to-day personal activites. Once you have a pseudo-explanation for how/why the world was created, youÂ´re free to add to that pseudo-explanation that â€œthe creator talksâ€. ItÂ´s impossible to add such a talking thing to my existential theory â€“ not only is it unnecessary (my theory works stand-alone) but it also contradicts basically every concept of my existential theory. The very definitions of energymasspacetime (meaning that God had nothingness as the canvas to paint on â€“ a nothingness that needs energymass and summons it because of the laws of nature inherent in that nothingness â€“ and chose to paint a beginning with as-dense-as-can-be (just like E=mc2 wouldÂ´ve created it because E=mc2 is true in the smallest spaces). Where was God when this happened? CouldnÂ´t have been energymass because energymass is only summoned once the universe becomes pure nothingness. If God is not energymass and energymass is existence â€“ then God doesnÂ´t exist / God is nothing. What doesnÂ´t exist or is nothing doesnÂ´t give revalations to men, doesnÂ´t care whom you sleep with, etc. Is God or GodÂ´s heaven a location in our size of infinite spacetime? In that case God is simply a far-away alien (which warrants questions about its evolution) but again â€“ it doesnÂ´t talk to us because of the distance and we wouldnÂ´t be too impressed even if an evolved God did talk to us (we are quite like it â€“ our science is the same, our world-view is the same). God is not a location in a size but is God a size? The sizerange is infinite (as proven by distinction not being able to see antidistinction) and thatÂ´d mean that thereÂ´s a creator to God (and that thing too has a creator, ad infinitum) IN THE SAME WAY as humans built cities or atoms make molecules. Again, if God is a size it warrantÂ´s the question: is God every location of that size or is God, like humans, in a location of that size? Whatever be the case, God still couldnÂ´t communicate with us. Since God fits neither in the context of energymasspacetime nor the context of the sizerange, a God-theory absolutely contradicts the true theory. What is said about God â€“ that God is the greatest â€“ makes only one â€œlocationâ€/notion in the existential theory correspond to a non-talking uncaring God: the theory itself (and more precisely Reality/[that of which all is part]) is the greatest. It certainly doesnÂ´t hear/talk nor give revalations because it comes as an infinite sizerange of energymasspacetime. When you tell this science, you can get to the point where you define Reality as â€œthat of which all is partâ€ and the greatest â€“ you can even get to antidistinction/the unrepresentability of Reality (fully, because we do represent some things) and people might still hope that a talking God can exist. But as soon as you mention the less abstract (the more abstract was that [that of which all is part cannot be observed]), the God-theory either surrenders or is in conflict with a/the existential theory which certainly is true (anyone can verify how the components of the theory fit together, make sense and explain everything). God as a synonym for Reality is boring â€“ why do we even have two words if we mean the same (scientific sizerange) thing.
If you assume that God is a synonym for Reality (which comes as an infinite sizescale, which in turn predicts a DNA-strand somewhere and voila: everything is explained), then I believe in your God. It doesnÂ´t appriciate my appriciation of it though, nor do rituals, following rules (made by men) etc please it. If I am to â€œshow my appriciation to itâ€ I do it by writing as I do right now â€“ thatÂ´s my worship of it: but IÂ´m under no illusion that this writing would please God by being logical (eventhough Reality itself is logical too â€“ so we have something incommon) â€“ me writing can be called worship but the only appriciating recipients of my writing are me and readers of my text. Whatever I write about Reality/God doesnÂ´t please God (because God is not a thing that listens, likes worship by others and other human needs) â€“ whatever worshippers do, I hope they do it for themselves and for other humans because no-one else is able to care or comprehend the worship. I would do the muslim prayer if I felt that that kind of discipline would benefit me (and a few times I did get a good feeling from going to the mosque and being among worshippers). ItÂ´s so easy to adapt to the customs of oneÂ´s peers (and especially oneÂ´s superiors, if one believes that there are those) that my attitude toward worship/ritual is â€œwhen in Rome, do like the romans (if you or others gain something out of it)â€. The world is complex â€“ I could have the same attitude toward the beliefs of islam: that IÂ´ll just say that something is through eventhough it obviously isnÂ´t because it contradicts, say, a talking holy book-writing God. Could I make myself believe that something talkative is God? The belief disintegrates and I get the foul feeling of that IÂ´ve used my valuable memory to note down a lie everytime I would think just one step/association further from the belief itself. I can believe (in anything) but analyzing it even the smallest amount will make me disbelieve it. But when youÂ´re in the mood of not analyzing â€“ like when one is having a panic attack on oneÂ´s death-bed â€“ IÂ´ll be (extremely) simplistic and do what some people seem to always do: â€œbelieve (in something that breaks down when analyzed)â€. What confuses me is that some people believe all the time â€“ they seem perfectly sane but they believe in a talking, scripture-giving God (that doesnÂ´t fit anywhere in the existential theory). Do they need comfort (from untruth) all the time? It seems like theyÂ´re trying to argue their position, though. A perplexing phenomenon at first glance but when you consider that theyÂ´re uneducated about my existential theory, any theory will do (even a talking God-theory). I am not hateful of it when I see it in other people â€“ I see it as humorous/ridicilous â€“ but when it binds people together (to form what in essence is an army) and thereÂ´s many of them (10 000 religions/â€armiesâ€) the worldÂ´s got a problem. Binding people together through their shared scripture and their belief that something impossible is true is bad because groups tend to be more violent than individualists â€“ especially if their holy text 1) seems to bind billions of people to their army (morale-strength amplification in a group is the root of violence), and 2) preaches violence/disrespect (many holy books are xenophobic and eager to create an â€œus vs. themâ€-social dynamic). If the holy book is taken seriously (if it canÂ´t be thrown in the trash) then we have bronze-age xenophobia (based on who likes the book and who doesnÂ´t) creeping into the modern day, and we also have artificial bonding/loyalty â€“ we basically get groups who are hostile (or more disrespectful) toward anyone who doesnÂ´t see the point (â€œthereÂ´s a talking Godâ€) theyÂ´re promoting. ItÂ´s such an easily fixable problem: if you read my work you simply cannot believe in a talking God â€“ my professional role is that you can give me ANY individual and I can â€œconvertâ€ him/her into not believing in a talking God. Whether this person will follow his or her groupÂ´s rituals or codes of conduct, though, is up to them â€“ itÂ´s sheer peer pressure.
The â€œus vs. themâ€ â€œwe are a big groupâ€ (and especially) â€œwe should convert the whole world so that they use their precious memory for knowing nonsense like we doâ€ are such great reasons for violence â€“ and of course itÂ´s fixable because what these people lack is education: only where there is no theory, can a pseudo-theory take root. Only where there is no argument/debate/science can â€œGod talksâ€ seem like legitimate truth. This means that much of the worldÂ´s violence is due to a lack of education (about the big questions i.e. what I talk about). Sure: some religions can be interpreted to say â€œkill the infidelsâ€ or some other explicit declaration of war â€“ but itÂ´s hard for a religion to survive if it constantly preaces fighting (it must have more clever tactics than that â€“ but it does tend to seek world-dominion). IÂ´m not so worried that someone reads the Quran and thinks â€œIÂ´ll help the [unbelieves in the QuranÂ´s talking God] to get to hell faster, because the Quran says that thatÂ´s where they belongâ€. I am worried about that the Quran (or any holy book) is the glue that binds people together. Religion is the last glue before we enter an era where obviously arbitrary things like nationalism or language makes strangers feel more familiar with eachother. Nation and language arenÂ´t taken that seriously â€“ nor should religion be, but it is. This binding-effect that holy books have is what makes ISIS / the taliban etc so hard to defeat â€“ they think, not only that they have an all-seeing revalation-giving God on their side, but they also have the exact same copy of a book that a billion people have. They feel strong (with their, seemingly to them, superior numbers). Obviously ISIS underestimated the ability of the Quran to draw in arab nations into the fight over Iraq & Syria â€“ the modern world simply leaned on the fact that ISIS are not muslims because they interpret the bronze-age ramble wrong. But ISIS / the taliban is still a factor â€“ the quran binds too many people together in certain areas of the world â€“ violence is caused, due to the binding-effect, the â€œmoral superiorityâ€-effect, the â€œpower in numbers and billions of people read the Quranâ€-effect etc (all these effects are there even if you skip the parts about the talking God who word for word said the Quran) make men as prone to violence as anything can make them: theyÂ´re a group with an â€œus vs. themâ€ dogma & feeling and they feel like they have power in numbers. Add to that the frustration over having to finance an own home before one can ejaculate. Those circumstances can make the group take up arms and â€œsend the infidels where they belongâ€. Following the commandments frustrates, the whole notion of â€œletÂ´s all prioritize this text highest (our favorite book) so that weÂ´re bound togetherâ€ and that the text itself can be interpreted as violent all are a breeding-ground for trouble â€“ and when youÂ´re in the trouble that the text creates, you are not in the state of mind to do the internal debate necessary to disprove a talking God and thus make your whole way of life become something that you either do as meaningless fun or donÂ´t do because no-one cares. But just as some people want to become professional soccer players and some atheists do zen-meditation, humans (by personal preference) want hobbies, to take up a discipline, to do something that adds, say, pride to their life. I donÂ´t personally care about soccer and I donÂ´t feel pride from doing any ritual, but I can definitely see that others take the muslim prayers like an athlete takes their sport. ItÂ´s possible to find out the objective truth about whether these prayers â€œplease God or notâ€ (by, like IÂ´ve done in this text, disproving all kinds of false Gods and making the real God more mundane and not a talker). Rituals donÂ´t please Reality/â€the energymasspacetime sizerangeâ€ because it is not a thing that gets pleased â€“ itÂ´s like trying to please a rock. You do the prayers because you enjoy the pride/hobby for its own sake â€“ like someone doing sports likes his/her sport. Pleasing a rock/God to get to a â€œheavenâ€ (which too doesnÂ´t fit into the true existential theory) is stupid unless itÂ´s akin to a hobby/sport where you do it for doing itÂ´s sake. Same thing with the â€œheaven hates hamâ€-thing â€“ when you know enough science (enough = what IÂ´ve written so far in this text) youÂ´ll realize that the whole ham-prohibition is man-made (from the bronze age) and linked to some pre-scientific nonsense from-the-horseÂ´s-mouth-
statement (canÂ´t say rationale because itÂ´s dogma). If you (and secondarily your peers) are dedicated to nonsense (whether it be sports, stamp-collecting, memorizing capitals or not eating pork), then do it if it does something good like prove to yourself (and others) that you have a strong discipline (even though your effort is misdirected toward nonsense). I can invent a ritual and do it every day, and maybe IÂ´d feel pride over that I can keep to a schedule of nonsense, but I would never claim the theory that there is a talking God, and by extention I wouldnÂ´t say that that ficticious talker prohibited ham. The mundane action must be differentiated from the logical argument. Ham-prohibitions and talking Gods are artifacts that belong in the past â€“ modern white A4-paper is too beautiful for someone to write something as erroneous as â€œthere is a talking Godâ€ on it. But as IÂ´m writing this, people are dying because religion binds them together (and frustrates them, and boosts their war-morale in many ways). My work can cause a civil war within ISIS â€“ a civil rift so permiating that only family ties, friendships and common goals (to get money, not to spread islam) can keep people together in groups. Once my existential theory is known there will still be crime and instability in Iraq, Syria and Afghanistan, but the evil deeds will only be committed by groups of 2-3 people â€“ not 20 000 of them. The binding effect of the Quran can most clearly be seen in that internet-propaganda made Quran-readers from the USA and Europe go fight in Syria â€“ everyone wants a group and itÂ´s totally human to assume that knowing the same book will be enough for a bond to be as strong as one wants it to be.
Right now â€œmy workâ€ is 9 proper texts and a few videos. They all talk about the same thing (which can be formulated as: IÂ´ll say as much as I can about things IÂ´ve never heard anyone else say (and IÂ´ve seen the best professors in the world teaching truths)). To cause a rift in the taliban/ISIS and stop the war by making group-bonding (around a holy book) problematic/impossible, my whole â€œworkâ€ doesnÂ´t need to be dropped as propaganda books on top of ISIS and the taliban. ItÂ´s enough that the news headlines say that â€œa correct all-explaining existential theory has been found â€“ religions in crysisâ€ or that enough people know my theory so that a multitude of youtube videos are made where, in a sentence or two, the presenter goes off-topic and mentions why we exist / something from my theory. Having understood it once makes it impossible to forget â€“ having understood it once makes group-bonding over religion (which fuels ISIS/the taliban/etc) impossible. If the world could just take 20 minutes of itsÂ´ time to spend on explaining/teaching/arguing my work/theory, then the war on terror would be over â€“ otherwise it will persist as long as people have no actual, logical theory about their existence and thus believe in bronze-age marketing tricks.
â€”â€”-
The theory of evolution begins with the first reproducing shape. It was a shape that assembled surrounding mass into a similar shape. The existential theory predicts the existence of infinitely many such shapes. What inevitable becomes true when you have reproduction is that some die and some survive (life and death), that the number of offspring that shape make matters and that there is mutations over time. This is true about the shapeÂ´s offspring: some will die and some will survive, the number of offspring they make matters and the offspring can be different from the original shape. These three rules / laws of nature were inactive before the first reproduction occurred. The next main event was that one of these shapes found that if it injected its DNA into other shapesÂ´ reproductive mechanism, it exploited principle number two: that the number of offspring matters. It was the first virus: it hijacked othersÂ´ reproduction. The rule / law of nature that came into play with this event was that â€œpowerâ€ matters: hijacking othersÂ´ reproductive mechanism gives evolutionary benefits. Now weÂ´ve listed the four main rules that govern evolutionary theory: first came the three first, and then came the forth: power. The next main event â€“ to guard against viruses taking over all life / reproductive mechanisms â€“ was that an immune system evolved to protect against virusÂ´ hijack attempts. This required multicellularism. Just like immune systems prompt/require multicellularism, immune systems prompt/require multigenderedism: to win in the arms race against quickly mutating viruses two genders arose to amplify the mutations to the immune system. Mixing genes from two genders creates a more mutated immune system, which can keep ahead in the arms race against quickly-mutating viruses â€œtryingâ€ to mutate to bypass any immune system. The next main event is that one of these multicellular organisms â€“ a fish or worm â€“ of the male gender mutated to be agressive and defeat other males in battle. He wouldÂ´ve gotten access to many more females than his non-agressive counter-parts. This too can be called â€œpowerâ€ because the agressive male hijacks other maleÂ´s access to females by killing the males. This prompts the dinosaurs because larger muscle mass and shaper weaponry is better at killing off competitors. Amongst the dinosaurs there was the mother-offspring bond, placed there by evolution for the evolutionary benefits a mother gets from seeing an offspring survive to adulthood. This bond mutated to involve flock-members because a group working together out-competes any individualists when fighting over anything. The next main event was that someone mapped the flock, in his brain, as a hierarchy (up-down-axis) with the longing to dominate peers.

Dude, evolution has me try to maximize evolutionary benefits using my plans; im always thinking at full speed and pain drives that thinking. And i know for certain that all this pain is meaningless. Its a suicide recipe but what prevents me from suicide is the natural strength that stems from being the pinnacle of beasts who all have survived for generations.

New book 2017
Chapter 1:
What problem does this solve?
This solves a problem that becomes most visible 60 years from now when sea-levels rise, the economy goes into permanent decline and oil ends. ThatÂ´s when humans start to fight (and belong in world-view-based groups to do so). While the economy is still rising the clashes are few and far between â€“ Afghanistan, Syria, ISISÂ´ world-wide terror attacks (mainly muslim world-views clashing with tolerant world-views). When the economy starts declining thereÂ´ll naturally be more friction between groups, and groups are made up of world-views (people identify as in a group based on world-view).
Advancing the scientific world-view to the level where it explains our origin and thus invades religious intellectual turf, solves the problem of world-views colliding as war.
Chapter 2:
Certain truth â€“ I think & I am
You have a composite certain truth consisting of two certain truths: you can claim as certain that you think (because if you were being fooled: being fooled is thinking) and that you exist (because being fooled requires the one who is fooled to be there). I think and I exist is one statement but two truths. You can certainly claim to have â€œdistinctionâ€ because youÂ´re dealing with multiple separate distinct entities (such as â€œIâ€ and â€œthoughtâ€). One could put it, while seeing the certain truths â€œI thinkâ€ and â€œI existâ€, that the space between the two notions (thinker and thought) is the hallmark of distinction. The distance separating thinker from thought we can recognize as necessary for â€œdistinctionâ€ to be concluded as a certain truth arising, in a next logical step, from the original primary certain truth.
Everyone agrees they they themselves exist, because if one would get fooled in everyone one can be fooled in then one would exist there anyway and be fooled. So one knows that one exists. Then one also knows that one thinks because â€œto get fooledâ€ is a thought-process. Thus we have two things: I think and I exist. And the distinction between them: and on the flipside of the paper we have the opposite of that: anti-distinction, and this can also be called â€œthat of which all is partâ€/Reality. And since we are in the distinction-side of the paper when we see something; when we see something there is distinction between us and that thing. Thus we cannot represent or see that which is on the other side of the paper i.e. that of which all is part / Reality. Nothing can represent â€“ because it is distinct â€“ Reality. So whatever which is distinct cannotâ€¦ whatever that is observed or represented is distinct and therefore is notâ€¦ therefore does not represent Reality / â€œthat of which all is partâ€. So we have distinction and anti-distinction as opposing poles.
You have a certain truth which everyone in the whole world agrees upon. You think and you exist since if you were being fooled by an almighty demon youÂ´d still both think and exist. Then there are two things i.e. distinction. All is part of a single reality which is anti-distinction, there are no separate parts: reality is one. If we put distinction on the left side of the paper and anti-distinction on the right side then (we) distinction cannot see that of which all is part because â€œto seeâ€ is â€œto representâ€ and then one uses something to refer to reality. There is nothing outside reality which can refer to reality but instead reality is defined as â€œthat of which all is partâ€ and then there is nothing that can refer to all of reality. The opposition between the two sides of the paper (distinction & anti-distinction) makes reality as â€œthat of which all is partâ€-anti-distinction non-representable because representation always involves distinction. What we see, for example, is just parts of reality. The hypotheses can be infinitely much so there is infinitely much to reality. Sizes and times, that is. In the existential theory (â€œwhy we existâ€) there, thus, is an infinite size-range with time, energymass in spacetime (everything and nothing intertwined like in the E=mc2 equation â€“ energy equals mass times, well â€“ spacetime; multiplication is what unites energymass with spacetime). Then we have distinction and anti-distinction: separate things but all is part of a single reality. The existential theory with its three pillars, that is an infinite sizerange, energymasspacetime and distinction-anti-distinction-opposition, predicts that there should be a tiny piece of DNA which copies itself.
Then thereÂ´s another kind of revelation that got respect. Descartes who lived in the 1600s got respect, fame and was invited to live with the Queen of Sweden because he had gotten an idea which certainly told us something true. Revelations can either be con menÂ´s statements like they were from ape-man and forward, or they can actually claim something which is verifyably true. Descartes, propably having his mind overcrowded by the masses of revelations that had accumulated to his time, asked: â€œwhat would be true if all my statements were false?â€. What would remain if I tossed all my knowledge and ideas into the trash? Are we stuck with countless unverifyable statements, some contradicting eachother, not knowing which ones are true and which ones are not? Obviously not since statements about architecture are obviously true since they build houses, while contradictory statements do not. So Descartes dared to throw all his knowledge in the trash to see what remained. He found certain truth: that he exists â€“ because even if he was wrong or was being fooled in everything he thought to be true, thereÂ´d still be a â€œheâ€ there. He certainly exists no matter what. Same thing goes for thoughts: being wrong or being fooled is a thinking-process so even if he was wrong or was being fooled in everything he thought, thereÂ´d still be thought.
Socrates: So he figured out that he thinks and he exists.
God: These are not one statement â€“ they are two.
Socrates: What does that mean?
God: IÂ´ll tell you later â€“ just agree with me that there is distinction between thinker and thought â€“ that the statements are two. ItÂ´s building on certain truth, and itÂ´s possible to build a wholeâ€¦ whatever it is that â€œsaves the worldâ€ from the coming economic decline by having everyone build on certain truth until the God-debate is settled. Remembering â€œdistinctionâ€ (between thinker and thought) will prevent the horror-scenario of large-scale future wars between people group-bound by religions, and instead â€“ since everyone built a whole world-view on certain truth â€“ have a more stable decline in the future. â€œDistinctionâ€ i.e. remembering that there are two certain truths (thinker and thought) is a step on the way toward a plan that will save humanity from destroying itself as much as it would if we didnÂ´t build our world-views on certain truth.
Plato: So after an era of â€œrevelationâ€-revelations invented by anyone for whatever purpose, coming from DarwinÂ´s ape-manÂ´s revelations, Descartes, in the 1600s, invented a revelation â€“ certain truth: I think and I exist â€“ which got him invited to the Queen of Sweden for the rest of his life. People have always liked revelations and even verifyable truth-claims like DescartesÂ´ get respect.
God: I have set it as true that each one of you humans can verify in your own mindÂ´s eye that you do certainly exist and that there certainly is thought â€“ and thus there is distinction.
Darwin: Distinction is an abstract word. That two objects are separate/different from one another is one of those notions and ape-man never made into language â€“ there was never the evolutionary need to talk about â€œdistinctionâ€. Yes: one could say that one banana is different from another (and one wants the bigger one), but to have Distinction exist stand-alone as a distinct notion is abstract thinking and we are not evolved to do that. For millions of years the caveman word for â€œdistinctionâ€ was only used in a sentance â€“ not stand-alone as in â€œdistinction certainly exists because thinker and thought are both certain truthsâ€.
Chapter 3:
Distinction-antidistinction-opposition
The first proof for that the size-time-diagram is infinite is distinctionÂ´s (our) inability to see/represent anti-distinction.
Chapter 4:
Maximum size?
The second prooof for that the size-time-diagram is infinite is that if we imagine a partless anti-distinction then it has no distinction as in a â€œmaximumâ€ or â€œminimumâ€ size, i.e. the size-range is infinite.
Chapter 5:
Infinite size-time-diagram
Chapter 6:
Existential theoryÂ´s 3 pillars

Everyone agrees on that reality is one. Because itÂ´s one nothing can represent it, because the representer too should be part of reality. That means that there is a size-time-diagram which is infinite. And thatÂ´s why we exist. Everyone agrees on this eventhough we are distinct unique individuals. We have this world-view incommon, with extraterrestrials too.

You know for certain that you think and that you exist because even if an almighty demon was fooling you in everything you can possibly be fooled in, the fooling itself is a thought-process and therefore you know that thought exists (you think), and for you to be fooled you have to exist and therefore you know "I exist". Being fooled is thinking and a thinker is necessary for there to be someone to be fooled. So you know: no matter what, you think and you exist. Those are two things, right? TheyÂ´re both part of the same brain and the thought-process can become the analytical toolkit/thinker, but still we recognize that there are distinct entities - there is distinction. This can also be called separation. What is distinctionÂ´s opposite, anti-distinction? ItÂ´s one reality; that of which all is part; itÂ´s one and realityÂ´s definition in the dictionary is that all is part of it. If we write distinction (thinker and thought) on the left side of the paper and anti-distinction (reality; that of which all is part; one) on the right side of the paper - can the left side see the right side? No, because of opposition between distinction and anti-distinction. Because of there always being an observer (a thinker) and thus distinction in every observation and thus anti-distinction canÂ´t be represented/seen.
The brain evolved to deal with natural occurances - there was never an event in history where something invisible was to be contemplated and dealt with. Thus we seem to assume that the thought-process went wrong when we say that distinction/us canÂ´t see anti-distinction/reality. But the thought-process didnÂ´t go wrong: all that it means is that there is more to reality than can be represented. Regardless of how vaguely "represents" is defined, say a coffee cup - regardless of brains being involved - is assumed to try to represent that of which all is part, then anti-dinstinction - distinction - opposition (the opposition between distinction and itÂ´s opposite) makes the representation incorrect. We can ask if there in an anti-distinct "thing" is a maximum size and thus distinction? No. Likewise, another proof for that the size-range is infinite is that we do sense something (our everyday world) and can make hypotheses ad infinitum, and yet nothing represent
s ALL OF reality. Reality i.e. s
ize-time thus is infinite.
The infinite size-range is one pillar in the existential theory. Another pillar is energymass and spacetime being opposites but intertwined as in E=mc
2
(where c
2
refers to a speed which is space over time: spacetime). Multiplication joins energymass together with spacetime; nothing together with something/everything; existence together with non-existence. Why is there existence the shape of my body? Without going into the historical answer, one can explain it by saying that the body is something in (intertwined with) nothing, of a size in an infinite size-range (where the relationship between any two sizes (or objects of two sizes) i
s that they make sense of i.e. j
ustify one another). Then there too, as a third pillar, is distinction-an
ti-distinction-opposition i.e. w
e live in a single (not plural) reality but we see distinct/separate entities such as thinker and thought.
Speaking of spacetime, spacetime is the logical starting point for the time-based existential theory.
Nothingness (empty space) needs n
o prior justification nor reason to exist, because it doesnÂ´t exist. In it, however
, laws of nature are true i.e. i
t is not irrational / anti-logical, and among the many laws of nature there are those, including E=mc
2
, which mention energymass.
Could energymass be "mentioned" without it existing? If yes, it would be absurd / anti-logical. Why would reality mention things that never exist? But since laws of nature are firm and because of our rule "what is mentioned must exist or must be summoned" we get, wherever (in the smallest spaces) that E=mc
2
is mentioned, existence and thus dense existence: a big bang. The fact that galaxies are speeding away acceleratingly from one another leads to nothingness in the future, and with the middleman "laws of nature" again energymass is summoned as dense as can be. No time-delay between nothingness - laws of nature - energymass but as soon as a bordered (by event horizons which are determined by the finite speed of light) region becomes nothingness, a big bang occurs and eventually becomes nothingness bordered by event horizons again. This is the time-wise description of why energymass (which exists intertwined with spacetime as in E=mc
2
) starts dense and becomes nothingness, and repeats.
All of the above is a rival theory to "God created earth in 6 days and rested on the 7th". It is unintuitive because it deals with things we didnÂ´t have to deal with in evolution: invisible energymasspacetime/reality/anti-distinction as a part of reasoning. It also has a multi-reason cause for our existence: a time-wise rationale involving the beginning and end of the big bang combined with a 3-pillar existential theory which justifies size and energymass. It is abstract/scientific but canÂ´t be reduced into simpler terms. ItÂ´s the lowest common denominator that everyone can believe in (regardless of religion).
How many is reality? One. How many is Allah? One. Can anything completely represent reality? No. Can anything completely represent Allah? No. Is reality the greatest (if all is part of it)? Yes. Is â€œAllah akbarâ€? Yes. Reality and Allah have these three things incommon â€“ so maybe reality is synonymous with Allah?
How vaguely has reality defined â€to representâ€?
Infinitely vaguely â€“ anything can represent anything.
Is the representation/representer reality or Allah?
No.
Can anything represent that of which all is part?
No.
Then the size-time-diagram is infinite i.e. nothing represents reality. How many is it? How many is Allah? 1.
Did it sayâ€¦, or did it wri
te a book?
This disproves Allah writing the Quran.
Again: how much of reality can be represented by, say, a painting? The whole of it?
No, the whole of reality cannot be represented. Just like Allah canÂ´t be captured in a picture/word.
We can have hypotheses â€“ how many hypotheses can we have?
If reality is sizes & times, energymass and spacetime then the square-shaped size-time-diagram with energymasspacetime in each coordinate is the universal way to represent all there is to represent.
Does it write books? No, it is not of such authorship-kind nature.
â€œGod said to Muhammed word by wordâ€¦â€ is thus a false or at most metaphorical statement.
â€œYou have to do rituals in order not to go to hell, and in heaven you get 72 virginsâ€ is by the same logic also a false claim.
There are three alternatives as the foundation for this logic â€“ can you think of a 4
th
one?
1: Reality is a synonym for Allah
2: or Allah doesnÂ´t exist
3: or there are 72 virgins (not an alternative because reality is not of the nature, because it is size-time-energymasspacetime, to write books).
In addition to the square size-time diagram with infinity symbols in each of itÂ´s corners, and the evolutionary triangle which designates that life becomes more complex as time goes on
(the triangle originates at the central size of the known size-range), there is the following brain diagram:
You have a composite certain truth consisting of two certain truths: you can claim as certain that you think (because if you were being fooled: being fooled is thinking) and that you exist (because being fooled requires the one who is fooled to be there). I think and I exist is one statement but two truths. You can certainly claim to have â€œdistinctionâ€ because youÂ´re dealing
with multiple separate distinct entities (such as â€œIâ€ and â€œthoughtâ€). One could put it, while seeing the certain truths â€œI thinkâ€ and â€œI existâ€, that the space between the two notions (thinker and thought) is the hallmark of distinction. The distance separating thinker from thought we can recognize as necessary for â€œdistinctionâ€ to be concluded as a certain truth arising, in a next logical step, from the original primary certain truth.
Are all distinct entities part of a single reality if â€œrealityâ€ is defined as â€œthat of which all is partâ€? In other words: if we draw distinction on the left side of a paper and anti-distinction (distinctionÂ´s opposite: a singular reality â€“ that of which all is part. Zooming out summarizing maximally) on the right side of the paper, then can distinction represent the right side of the paper i.e. anti-distinction? How could some distinct entities depict the very opposite of what representation/distinction is? Any depiction/representation of anti-distinction/reality has at least three entities: thinker, space between thinker and thought, and thought. Separation/distinction is inherent in representation, thus anti-distinction is unrepresentable.
How vaguely has the universe/God defined what a representation is i.e. when a representation occurs? Our brains use neurons to represent, but what if â€“ instead of neurons (regardless of brains) â€“ the universe wills that any random object can be said to, as neurons do, represent reality? The universe has defined â€œrepresentationâ€ infinitely vaguely i.e. disregarding brains, any random object spontaneously is the symbol standing for all of reality â€“ because the universe defines â€œrepresentsâ€ infinitely vaguely. Despite the infinitely vague definition of what represents what, distinction-anti-distinction-opposition (the line separating the left side of the paper from the right side; the countering of distinction with anti-distinction) means that reality is not representable. If reality is anti-distinction then no distinction (representation is inherently distinction) can even, despite an infinitely vague definition of â€œrepresentsâ€, capture reality.
In
representations we can count at least three things and what weÂ´re trying to capture is one thing with nothing outside it. The fact that representations contain distinction makes capturing reality (all is one) impossible.
We can have infinitely many or infinitely large/substancefull representations/hypotheses â€“ such as an infinite size-time-diagram â€“ and though abstractly accurately pointing to reality, the universeÂ´s rule that nothing represents reality despite infinitely vaguely allowed representations of infinitely much, makes reality unrepresentable. This can only mean one thing: reality â€“ which we know as sizes and times (a size-time-diagram) â€“ is infinite. ThereÂ´s infinitely large and infinitely small with infinitely much past and infinitely much future. This square-shaped size-time-diagram i.e. our everyday experience of size-time has infinities all-over the place.
Energymass in spacetime: one in zero, existence in non-existence, something in nothing â€“ as defined by E=mc
2
where c
2
stands for speed (distance over time i.e. spacetime/zero/non-existence) and E=m referring to energymass (existence, something, all).
Distinction-anti-distinction-opposition: we live in a singular reality but we see multiple objects.
An infinite size-range.
The above three ideas are an existential theory (a theory which explains the existence of a reproducing shape and thus the dawn of evolution and thus our existence). It is modern to utilize three equal ideas to explain oneÂ´s existence â€“ all previous existential theories used either a single idea (monotheism) or a saga (multiple mundane (not very scientific/abstract) ideas) to explain existence.
The predictive quality that makes this existential theory a scientific theory is that it, basing it off an infinite size-range of energymasspacetime and distinction-anti-distinction-opposition, predicts that in an infinite size-range there ought to be a size where reproduction occurs. The existential theory predicts the first DNA, and from there we get to the evolutionary theory.
Another predictive quality is that the theory predicts a
dense
Big Bang. The a priori beginning of the universe logically is emptiness because emptiness doesnÂ´t need any prior logical justification for its existence because it doesnÂ´t exist. In emptiness laws of nature are true, such as the laws pointing toward and handleing energymass (like E=mc
2
), and thus the Big Bang begins infinitely dense because E=mc
2
is equally true simultaneously in the smallest of spaces. Tiny empty spaces having E=mc
2
be true in them simultaneously and directly as there was nothingness predicts a dense Big Bang. A region, contained within event horizons made out of energymasses speeding away at >c (due to dark energy causing accelerating cosmic expansion), is by definition â€œnothingâ€ in which E=mc
2
being true in the tiniest spaces summons a dense big bang out of reach of the closest (v = >c) energymass. Nothingness (out of reach for the closest energymasses because they are speeding away at >c) is summoned in the central point with event horizons as the furthest away border, causing Big Bang (due to laws of nature summoning energymass in the empty center).
The theory of evolution begins with the first reproducing shape. It was a shape that assembled surrounding mass into a similar shape. The existential theory predicts the existence of infinitely many such shapes. What inevitable becomes true when you have reproduction is that some die and some survive (life and death), that the number of offspring that shape make matters and that there is mutations over time. This is true about the shapeÂ´s offspring: some will die and some will survive, the number of offspring they make matters and the offspring can be different from the original shape. These three rules / laws of nature were inactive before the first reproduction occurred. The next main event was that one of these shapes found that if it injected its DNA into other shapesÂ´ reproductive mechanism, it exploited principle number two: that the number of offspring matters. It was the first virus: it hijacked othersÂ´ reproduction. The rule / law of nature that came into play with this event was that "power" matters: hijacking othersÂ´ reproductive mechanism gives evolutionary benefits. Now weÂ´ve listed the four main rules that govern evolutionary theory: first came the three first, and then came the forth: power. The next main event - to guard against viruses taking over all life / reproductive mechanisms - was that an immune system evolved to protect against virusÂ´ hijack attempts. This required multicellularism. Just like immune systems prompt/require multicellularism, immune systems prompt/require multigenderedism: to win in the arms race against quickly mutating viruses two genders arose to amplify the mutations to the immune system. Mixing genes from two genders creates a more mutated immune system, which can keep ahead in the arms race against quickly-mutating viruses "trying" to mutate to bypass any immune system. The next main event is that one of these multicellular organisms - a fish or worm - of the male gender mutated to be ag
g
ressive and defeat other males in battle. He wouldÂ´ve gotten access to many more females than his non-ag
g
ressive counter-parts. This too can be called "power" because the ag

ressive male hijacks other maleÂ´s access to females by killing the males. This prompts the dinosaurs because larger muscle mass and shaper weaponry is better at killing off competitors. Amongst the dinosaurs there was the mother-offspring bond, placed there by evolution for the evolutionary benefits a mother gets from seeing an offspring survive to adulthood. This bond mutated to involve flock-members because a group working together out-competes any individualists when fighting over anything. The next main event was that someone mapped the flock, in his brain, as a hierarchy (up-down-axis) with the longing to
be the top of the hierarchy. This capitalist striving for
the top made brains grew larger â€“ larger memory-banks, more accurate predictions and faster planning are all advantages coming
from a larger cortex.
Power lead men to accumulate resources â€“ the very resources females needed for their children. Females care most about their children because they pass on their genes, so in finding a male they aim for loyalty plus status/power/placement in the hierarchy. Females think a lot about how others â€“ especially suitors â€“ perceive them and therefore males evolved the subconscious mechanism, to keep womenâ€™sÂ´ attention, to push-pull i.e. to, in one coherent fluent conversation, both say negative feedback about the woman and positive feedback.
It is a major historical event that there finally is an atheistic argument that is sh
aped like a university course: i
t is an existential theory plus evolution which not only doesnÂ´t need a personified god to function, but the pillars (infinite sizerange of energymasspacetime and distinction-anti-distinction-opposition) canÂ´t have a personified god added to them as a 4th pillar without the theory sounding ridicilous. Not only does the theory not need a personified god but adding a god destroys the minimalistic rationally complete beauty of the theory. Gods uglify the theory. The dawn of the theory is a major historical event because never before has an entire course (beginning with certain truth, going through the existential theory and ending in evolution) been laid out in the intellectual debate of atheism, as an argument against a personified god.
The anatomy in the brain from hearing certain truth (I think & I am) - the beginning of the course - creates the same neuronal pathways / associations between ideas in every single person who knows certain truth. The logical step to "distinction" is noting, as a meta-analysis of the primary certain truth, that one has many ideas (I think AND I am) and that one can take logical pathways to the next step in the course (distinction exists). Then juxtaposing anti-distinction with distinction creates the unseeable - "defying reason" (because reason is, in simple people, only visual) - conclusion that we/distinction cannot see reality/anti-distinction. The distinction-anti-distinction-opposition is hard to grasp because it - like formal logic or math - uses words instead of pictures (the linguistic brainhalf rather than the visual one). We evolved to be like "if I see it I believe it" and that was a good heuristic (rule of thumb) because practical sequences of events can be verified as true or untrue by visualizing them. But in this philosophy: no - it has to be linguistic that we deny ourselves the concept "all of reality", leading to the conclusion that there is more to reality than anything - however vaguely the universe has defined "represent" - can represent. This adds infinitely many sizes to our abstract size-range / size-time-diagram; it makes a square (with size on the y-axis and time on the x-axis) with infinity symbols in each corner, which in turn becomes a pillar in our personified-god-denying existential theory.
To come from certain truth, through mere logical steps (meta-analyses and juxtaposition of opposites), to an existential theory which predicts evolution is a major historical event in the history of atheism.
In a historical context the anatomy (neural connections between ideas and sequences of logic) created by this course is like a paradigm-shift into a new era of earth society - an era similar to
that existent on infinitely many other planets who have come further than our midway-mark in a regular water-bearing planetÂ´s history.
Evolution, by beginning with "a mass that can assemble surrounding mass into a similar shape" steps forth from the existential theoryÂ´s infinite size-range of energymasspacetime. Assuming DNA is the replication-molecule, we can step - skipping over how cell walls evolved etc - to the fact that viruses mutate to hijack othersÂ´ reproductive system. This - in this universal inter-planetary extraterrestrial culture - is formulated, in books of logic, as first three rules arising (life/death, number of offspring matters and "there is mutation in each generation-shift") and then a forth rule arising (power, with viruses). This story - which in our course begins from a first reproducing shape and ends with finessing the anatomy of power in men - is visualizable like the caveman story-telling narratives we evolved to hear/see. We can proof-check its validity/possibility by following the narrative visually. The visual nature of evolution is in stark contrast to the purely linguistic/abstract nature of the existential theory.
Speaking o
f "abstract" descriptions i.e. d
escriptions that make it very clear to us that our understanding of the universe is a mere map (a reference) and not reality itself (mind you of PlatoÂ´s or KantÂ´s cave-metaphor and "the thing is not the thing itself" -philosophies)... The size-range of energymasspacetime,
at the size of quantum physics
has us describe photons etc using both the wave-description which focu
s
es on lengths of space (this is the "spacetime description") AND - in wave-particle duality - the energymass description that the energy of a photon is its color. Color (as perceived through the eyes), wave/spacetime-description and particle-energy/energymass-description all are valid descriptors of quantum particles. This ability of ours to describe any mass/phenomenon using both energymass- and spacetime-descriptions runs throughout the entire size-range. You can imagine two lines - one representing energymass and the other representing spacetime - running vertically through the pictures on the size-axis. Adding complexity to this, there is likewise two lines - gravity and electromagnetism - both running through the size-axis, gravity having itÂ´s duality of energymass and spacetime descriptions and electromagnetism too having both, in every level of the size-range, energymass and spacetime descriptions. Gravity is both Newtonian "masses pulling toward masses" (energymassÂ´ focus on mass) and Einsteinian "curvature of spacetime" (spacetimeÂ´s focus on space) - both descriptors are accurate.
We are half-way in a planetÂ´s history â€“ 4.5 billion years have passed and 5 billion remain. The theory you now know is, in other words, in cosmic majority â€“ more planets have it than not (if it takes approximately half of a planetÂ´s history to invent it and if it remains true for the rest of the planetÂ´s history). Most other planets i.e. the majority of extraterrestrials are ideological adherents of the theory. Spread this theory to get approval of the majority even though it lives light-years away. Currently 99.9% of the worldÂ´s population lives in the era of religions â€“ spread this theory to end religious wars and terrorism like 9/11. The world-view (the view/diagrams that explain the world) is the same in the cosmic majority.
IÂ´ve worked 10 years to invent this theory and as alone bearing it itÂ´s my responsibility that it spreads. The future civilization in which everyone has the same world-view thus is dependent on me. I feel a
unique ability to influence earthÂ´s future.
You, as one who has partaken of this rare knowledge, should also feel a responsibility about spreading it to change the world.
IÂ´ve talked about the emotional repertoire in the brain-diagram. If we were to genetically engineer (DNA-manipulate) a next generation, we would A) give it an incredible sense of humor and knowledge so it could entertain us, and/or B) make it a super-happy retard â€“ retarded because positive emotions donÂ´t motivate â€“ they pacify â€“ so super-happy is equal to looking like a mongoloid; needs and wants and everything that drives us is painful â€“ pain motivates while super-happiness pacifies. We would, by creating these DNA-engineered emotional repertoires (to accomplish the dual goal of incredible happiness and incredible entertainers/comedians/philosophers), be doing something that is done on other planets â€“ these are universal engineering goals. I need money to accomplish this project. If you wish to contribute, contact yonis1@gmail.com
You know that gold plate we sent up into space for aliens to find? It had etched on it images of man, some music, some other picturesâ€¦ We didnÂ´t send up the diagram discussed in this book. If the aliens see the gold plate we did send up, theyÂ´ll read between the lines â€“ seeing that there is no universal diagram â€“ and conclude that: â€œon earth they still believe in godsâ€.
You know how most people dedicate a large part of their lives to religion? Once they understand my tattoo (diagram) theyÂ´ll ask themselves: â€œwhat the hell have I been praying to?â€ It resembles a tiny needle popping a big balloon.
If this book goes mainstream, the future becomes so interesting that one forgets oneÂ´s everyday problems.
Interesting important things relieve
anxiety
(especially when they contain humor like a universal tattoo).
Nazis were friends with Nazis, communists were friends with communists, USA was friends with USA, when jihadists meet they share the same ideology and thus bond quickly. My
theory/ideology/religion-replacer is empathy-increasing.
The more things people agree upon the better.
In the diagram/tattoo there are about 16 â€œlinesâ€ (hundreds if we consider the emotional repertoire being drawn the same on other planets). The sport is to draw as many universal lines as possible â€“ drawn from science so they can be drawn from science anywhere in the infinite universe.
God is a war-motivator. They say â€œthere are no atheists in trenchholesâ€. You need a bit of God to do war.
ItÂ´s hard to be an atheist warrior. My book, by disproving god, thus makes motivation for war less.
Gods contribute nothing â€“ one will have the full human experience-repertoire without gods.
Rather no direction than the wrong direction â€“ gods only contribute to war; itÂ´s better to be tolerantly caveman, uncaring of ideologies/world-views, than to be religious.
It seems mean to say that â€œitÂ´s their fault that religious wars keep on going â€“ those that wonÂ´t studyâ€, but itÂ´s good marketing.
Accomplices.
From having read this book, the following should now be understandable:
Certain truth leads to the conclusion â€œdistinctionâ€, and simultaneously warrants an anti-distinction defined as â€œthat of which all is partâ€. The opposition between distinction and anti-distinction â€“ despite â€œrepresentationâ€ being ubiquitous (infinitely vaguely defined) â€“ together with the â€œmax size?â€-question asked in anti-distinction â€“ supports the fact that reality i.e. size-time is infinite. This then becomes our pillar in our existential theory that moves God away from a creator role. The two other pillars are energimasspacetime (found in E=mc
2
) and the opposition that we live in a singular reality yet see multiple things. From the middle of the known size-range (which itself is part of the infinite size-range) comes the tip of a triangle which symbolizes evolution. From evolution, then, comes the brain diagram with dopamine & serotonin across the visual and linguistic brainhalves, and a lower box which is our 3-category emotional repertoire; the most common 4 emotions in our idle society being power-hungryness (how to elevate oneself in the socioeconomic hierarchy if one is a man; and for females itÂ´s mapping the status-hierarchy of men in their social group as to find them differently attractive), expanding oneÂ´s world-view, planning sex and planning resource-gathering/work.
This makes for a multi-symbol diagram involving the existential theoryÂ´s three pillars holding up the square-triangle-brain (size-time-diagram, evolution, brain) diagram.
Certain truth is or leads to distinction, which itself â€“ as all distinct things are â€“ is part of anti-distinction.
This is like saying obvious things about the reality/everyday world in front of us: such as that size is infinite and that it is something in nothing. All this, in turn, leads us to draw a square: a size-time diagram with infinity-symbols in all 4 corners. From the middle of the known size-range,
then, comes a triangle â€“ evolution â€“ which ends up in the brain with serotonine, dopamine, two brainhalves, a cortex and an emotional repertoire (upper- and lower box). In the emotional repertoire there are 4 idle emotions, among them â€œseeking powerâ€ â€“ power here is defined as outcompeting other males (if oneself is male) in a status competition, but the principle of diminishing other malesÂ´ reproductive capabilities happened at several stages in evolution: males fighting males (growing bigger to become dinosaurs) or viruses hijacking reproductive mechanisms of single-celled organisms.
The search for power thus has led to brain-size growing (when competing for upwardness in hierarchies) but also things like T-rexÂ´s claws or the 1918 flu â€“ not to mention war.
Previous atheists have moved God from a place where do intervenes in everyday life using miracles, to a God that set everything in motion but then doesnÂ´t intervene. My philosophy places God as a bum who watches a skyscraper get built â€“ the bum then gets praised for the skyscraper getting built even though the bum didnÂ´t contribute anything: at most he watched as other mechanisms got everything done. Or God is a football fan who cheers at the players but doesnÂ´t himself contribute to making goals. Natural mechanisms create the world â€“ no need to praise God.
This book is worth you reading if it solves (or significantly helps) a major problem.
It is good marketing of my book to outline
the problem that I solve here.
USA is better than war, right? USA has poor folks committing crime â€“ thatÂ´s far better than nations waring. I move the problem from a macro-scale where nations fight eachother over oil, to an individualistic/family-based/friendship-based micro-scale where everyone feels as ideological/religious comrades â€“ empathy and friendship-buildingly sharing the knowledge of this book. I can get everyone to have the same ideology/religion-replacement so that thereÂ´ll be no war over the oil that has made us rich enough to not witness babies dying every day. Nations, races, ideologies, religions â€“ large groups â€“ makes the difference between war and crime. I solve the problems of macro-war and the friendship problem once everyone knows my diagrams. The post-oil decline isnÂ´t going to be pretty but we can take all measures to alleviate it â€“ spread this book.
If God is defined as â€œthe reason for existenceâ€ and I present a complete existential theory as a diagram, and I tattoo the diagram on my arm, is my arm then God? No, just a symbol for the reason for existence. One can tattoo an explanatory model for existence and God has during thousands of years been defined as the cause for existence.

Texten bÃ¶rjar med sÃ¤ker sanning, sedan gÃ¥r den till att fÃ¶rklara varfÃ¶r nÃ¥gonting existerar istÃ¤llet fÃ¶r ingenting (den existentiella teorin â€“ varfÃ¶r vi existerar), sedan gÃ¥r den till evolutionÃ¤r teori vilket fÃ¶rutsÃ¤gs av den existentiella teorin. Den evolutionÃ¤ra teorin fÃ¶rklarar vardagsfenomen.
Du vet med sÃ¤kerhet att du tÃ¤nker och att du existerar eftersom om du skulle bliva lurad av en allsmÃ¤ktig demon som fÃ¶rsÃ¶ker lura dig i allt du kan bli lurad i, sÃ¥ Ã¤r lurendrejeriet i sig en tanke-process och dÃ¤rfÃ¶r vet du att tankar existerar (du tÃ¤nker). FÃ¶r att du ska bli lurad sÃ¥ mÃ¥ste du existera och dÃ¤rfÃ¶r vet du â€jag existerarâ€. Att bli lurad Ã¤r en tankeprocess och tÃ¤nkaren Ã¤r nÃ¶dvÃ¤ndig fÃ¶r att det ska finnas nÃ¥gon som blir lurad. SÃ¥ du vet: oavsett vad sÃ¥ tÃ¤nker du och existerar du. Ã…vanstÃ¥ende Ã¤r tvÃ¥ saker, eller hur? De Ã¤r bÃ¥da del av samma hjÃ¤rna och samma tankeprocess kan bli ens analytiska verktygssats/tÃ¤nkare, men vi erkÃ¤nner Ã¤ndÃ¥ att det finns distinkta entiteter â€“ att det finns distinktion. Detta kan ocksÃ¥ kallas separation. Vad Ã¤r distinktions motsats, anti-distinktion? Det Ã¤r en verklighet; det som allt Ã¤r del av; den Ã¤r en och dess definition i ordboken Ã¤r att allt Ã¤r del av den. Om vi skriver distinktion (tÃ¤nkare och tanke) pÃ¥ vÃ¤nster sida av ett papper och anti-distinktion (verkligheten; det som allt Ã¤r del av; en) pÃ¥ hÃ¶ger sida av pappret â€“ kan den vÃ¤nstra sidan se den hÃ¶gra sidan? Nej, fÃ¶r att oppositionen mellan distinktion och anti-distinktion. Det finns alltid en observerare (tÃ¤nkaren) och dÃ¤rmed distinktion i varje observation och dÃ¤rmed kan anti-distinktion ej representeras/ses.
HjÃ¤rnan evolverade fÃ¶r att hantera naturliga fenomen â€“ det fanns aldrig ett scenario i historien dÃ¥ nÃ¥gonting osynligt behÃ¶vde hanteras och betÃ¤nkas. DÃ¤rfÃ¶r antar vi att tanke-processen blev fel nÃ¤r vi sÃ¤ger att distinktion/vi inte kan se anti-distinktion/verkligheten. Men tankeprocessen gick inte fel: allt det betyder Ã¤r att det finns mer till verkligheten Ã¤n kan representeras. Oavsett hur vagt â€representerasâ€ Ã¤r definierat, lÃ¥t oss sÃ¤ga att en kaffekopp â€“ oavsett om hjÃ¤rnor Ã¤r involverade eller inte â€“ antas fÃ¶rsÃ¶ka representera det som allt Ã¤r del av, dÃ¥ gÃ¶r anti-distinktions-distinktions-oppositionen (motsÃ¤ttningen mellan distinktion och dess motsats) att representationen Ã¤r inkorrekt. Vi kan frÃ¥ga om en anti-distinkt â€sakâ€ har en maximumstorlek och dÃ¤rmed distinktion? Nej. PÃ¥ samma not Ã¤r ett annat bevis fÃ¶r att storleksskalan Ã¤r oÃ¤ndlig Ã¤r att vi ser nÃ¥gonting (vÃ¥r vardagsvÃ¤rld) samt kan gÃ¶ra hypoteser ad infinitum, och Ã¤ndÃ¥ representerar ingenting ALL verklighet. Verkligheten dvs storlek-tid Ã¤r dÃ¤rfÃ¶r oÃ¤ndligt.
En oÃ¤ndlig storleksskala Ã¤r en av pelarna i den existentiella teorin. En annan pelare Ã¤r att energimassa och rumtid Ã¤r motsatser (opposition) men sammanflÃ¤tade sÃ¥som i E=mc
2
(dÃ¤r c
2
hÃ¤nvisar till en hastighet dvs rum Ã¶ver tid: rumtid). Multiplikationen sammanfÃ¶r energimassa tillsammans med rumtid; ingenting tillsammans med nÃ¥gonting/allting; existens tillsammans med icke-existens. VarfÃ¶r finns det existens i form av min kropp? Utan att gÃ¥ in i det historiska svaret sÃ¥ kan man fÃ¶rklara det genom att sÃ¤ga att kroppen Ã¤r nÃ¥gonting i (sammanflÃ¤tat med) ingenting, av en storlek i en oÃ¤ndlig storleks-skala (dÃ¤r relationen mellan vilka tvÃ¥ storlekar som helst (eller objekt av tvÃ¥ storlekar) Ã¤r att de Ã¤r fÃ¶rklaringen till varandra dvs rÃ¤ttfÃ¤rdigar varandra. Sedan finns det ocksÃ¥, som tredje pelare, distinktions-anti-distinktions-opposition dvs vi lever i en singular (ej plural) verklighet men ser distinkta/separata entiteter sÃ¥som tÃ¤nkare och tanke.
PÃ¥ tal om rumtid, rumtid Ã¤r den logiska startpunkten fÃ¶r den tidsbaserade existentiella teorin. Ingenting (tom rumtid) behÃ¶ver inget inledande/tidigare rÃ¤ttfÃ¤rdigande eller anledning att existera, fÃ¶r att det existerar inte. I den, hursomhelst, Ã¤r naturlagarna sanna dvs den Ã¤r inte irrationell / anti-logisk, och bland naturlagarna finns de som, inklusive E=mc
2
, som nÃ¤mner energimassa. Skulle energimassa kunna â€nÃ¤mnasâ€ utan att det skulle existera? Om â€jaâ€ sÃ¥ skulle det vara absurt / anti-logiskt. VarfÃ¶r skulle verkligheten nÃ¤mna saker som aldrig existerar? Eftersom naturlagarna Ã¤r strikta och tack vare vÃ¥r regel â€det som nÃ¤mns mÃ¥ste existera eller uppstÃ¥â€ sÃ¥ fÃ¥r vi, varÃ¤n (i de minsta storlekarna) dÃ¤r E=mc
2
nÃ¤mns, sÃ¥ finns existens och dÃ¤rfÃ¶r en tÃ¤t big bang. Faktumet att galaxer rusar ivÃ¤g accelererandes frÃ¥n varandra leder till ingenting (tom rymd) i framtiden, och med mellanhanden â€naturlagarâ€ sÃ¥ uppstÃ¥r energimassa igen sÃ¥ tÃ¤t som den kan vara. Ingen tids-delay mellan ingenting â€“ naturlagar â€“ energimassa men sÃ¥ snart en begrÃ¤nsad (av event-horizons som bestÃ¤ms av ljuset Ã¤ndliga hastighet) region blir ingenting/tomrum, sÃ¥ uppstÃ¥r en big bang som sedan genom kosmisk expansion blir ingenting igen, som sedan blir tomrum och en ny big bang igen. Detta Ã¤r den tidsmÃ¤ssiga beskrivningen om varfÃ¶r energimassa (som existerar sammanflÃ¤tad med rumtid sÃ¥som i E=mc
2
) bÃ¶rjar tÃ¤t och blir ingenting, och sedan repetitation.
Det Ã¥vanstÃ¥ende Ã¤r en rivalteori till â€Gud skapade jorden pÃ¥ 6 dagar och vilade pÃ¥ den sjundeâ€. Den Ã¤r inte intuitiv eftersom den har att gÃ¶ra med saker som vi inte hade att gÃ¶ra med under evolutionen: osynliga energimassarumtid/verkligheten/anti-distinktion som del av vÃ¥rt resonemang. Den har ocksÃ¥ en multi-anledning orsak fÃ¶r vÃ¥r existens: en tidsvis rationale involverandes bÃ¶rjan och slutet pÃ¥ big bang, kombinerad med en 3-pelares existentiell teori som rÃ¤ttfÃ¤rdigar storlek och energimassa. Den Ã¤r abstrakt/vetenskaplig men kan inte reduceras till simplare termer. Det Ã¤r den minsta gemensamma nÃ¤mnaren som alla kan tro pÃ¥ (oavsett religion).
Hur vagt har verkligheten definerat â€att representeraâ€?
OÃ¤ndligt vagt â€“ vad som helst kan representera vad som helst.
Ã„r representationen/representÃ¶ren verkligheten eller Allah?
Nej.
Kan nÃ¥gonting representera det som allt Ã¤r del av?
Nej.
DÃ¥ Ã¤r storleks-tids-diagrammet oÃ¤ndligt dvs inget representerar verkligheten. Hur mÃ¥nga Ã¤r den? Hur mÃ¥nga Ã¤r Allah? 1.
Sa denâ€¦, eller skrev den en bok?
Detta motbevisar att Allah skrev en bok.
Igen: hur mycket av verkligheten kan representeras av, sÃ¤g, en mÃ¥lning? All den?
Nej, hela verkligheten kan ej representeras. Precis som Allah inte kan fÃ¥ngas i ett ord/en bild.
Vi kan ha hypoteser â€“ hur mÃ¥nga hypoteser kan vi ha?
Om verkligheten Ã¤r storlekar och tider, energimassa och rumtid sÃ¥ Ã¤r det rektangulÃ¤ra storleks-tids-diagrammet med energimassarumtid i varje koordinat det universella sÃ¤ttet att representera allt som finns att representera.
Skriver den bÃ¶cker? Nej, den Ã¤r inte av fÃ¶rfattarnatur.
â€Gud sa till Muhammed ord fÃ¶r ordâ€¦â€ Ã¤r alltsÃ¥ ett falskt eller som mest ett metaforiskt pÃ¥stÃ¥ende.
â€Du mÃ¥ste gÃ¶ra ritualer fÃ¶r att inte hamna i helvetet, och i himmelen fÃ¥r du 72 oskulderâ€ Ã¤r med samma logik ocksÃ¥ ett falskt pÃ¥stÃ¥ende.
Det finns tre alternativ som fundament fÃ¶r denna logik â€“ kan du tÃ¤nka ut ett fjÃ¤rde?
1: Verkligheten Ã¤r ett synonym fÃ¶r Allah,
2: eller sÃ¥ finns inte Allah
3: eller sÃ¥ finns 72 oskulder (ej ett alternativ eftersom verkligheten inte Ã¤r av den naturen, dÃ¥ den Ã¤r storleks-tids-energimassarumtid, att den skriver bÃ¶cker).
Som tillÃ¤gg till det rektangulÃ¤ra storleks-tids-diagrammet med oÃ¤ndlighetssymboler i varje hÃ¶rn, och den evolutionÃ¤ra triangeln som representerar att livet blev mer komplext ju mer tiden gick (triangelns spets har sitt ursprung i mittersta storleken i den kÃ¤nda storleksskalan), finns fÃ¶ljande hjÃ¤rn-diagram:
Den existentiella teorin med dess tre pelare, dvs en oÃ¤ndlig storleksskala, energimassarumtid och distinktions-anti-distinktions-opposition, fÃ¶rutsÃ¤ger att det borde finnas en liten bit DNA som kopierar sig.
Evolutionsteorin bÃ¶rjar med den fÃ¶rsta reproducerande formen. Det var en form som samlande kringliggande massa till en liknande form. Den existentiella teorin fÃ¶rutsÃ¤ger existensen av oÃ¤ndligt mÃ¥nga sÃ¥dana former. Det som oundvikligen blir sant nÃ¤r man har reproduktion Ã¤r att vissa dÃ¶r medan andra Ã¶verlever (liv och dÃ¶d), att antalet avkomma/kopior formen gÃ¶r har betydelse och att det finns mutationer Ã¶ver tid. FÃ¶ljande Ã¤r sant om formens avkomma: vissa dÃ¶r medan andra Ã¶verlever, antalet avkomma har betydelse och avkomman Ã¤r annorlunda frÃ¥n originalformen. Dessa tre regler / naturlagar var inaktiva innan den fÃ¶rsta reproduktionen skedde. NÃ¤sta stora steg var nÃ¤r ett av dessa former mÃ¶jliggjorde fÃ¶r sig sjÃ¤lv att injicera sitt DNA in i andra formers reproduktiva mekanism, vilket utnyttjade princip nr 2: att antalet avkomma har betydelse. Det var det fÃ¶rsta viruset: den hijackade andras reproduktion. Regeln / naturlagen som kom i spel i.om. denna hÃ¤ndelse var att â€maktâ€ har betydelse: att hijacka andras reproduktiva mekanism ger evolutionÃ¤ra fÃ¶rdelar. Nu har vi lagt fram de fyra huvudregelerna som Ã¤r evolutionsteori: fÃ¶rst kom de tre fÃ¶rsta reglerna, sedan kom den fjÃ¤rde: makt. NÃ¤sta stora hÃ¤ndelse â€“ fÃ¶r att skydda mot att virus hijackar alla reproduktiva system â€“ var att ett immunsystem evolverade fÃ¶r att skydda mot virus hijacks-fÃ¶rsÃ¶k. Detta behÃ¶vde multicellulÃ¤rism. Precis som immunsystem krÃ¤ver multicellularism, sÃ¥ behÃ¶ver immunsystem multikÃ¶nadhet: fÃ¶r att vinna i kampen dÃ¤r virus muterar fÃ¶r att kringgÃ¥ immunsystem sÃ¥ behÃ¶ver immunsystemet ocksÃ¥ maximalt med mutation. Att mixa gener frÃ¥n tvÃ¥ kÃ¶n skapar ett mer muterat immunsystem, vilket hÃ¥ller ut i kampen mot virus dÃ¤r virus â€fÃ¶rsÃ¶kerâ€ mutera sig runt immunsystemet. Den nÃ¤sta stora hÃ¤ndelsen var att en av dessa multicellulÃ¤ra organismer â€“ en fisk eller mask â€“ av det manliga kÃ¶net muterade till att vara agressiv och fÃ¶rinta andra manliga varelser. Han skulle ha fÃ¥tt hÃ¶gre tillgÃ¥ng till kvinnliga organismer jÃ¤mfÃ¶rt med hans icke-agressiva likar. Detta kan ocksÃ¥ kallas â€maktâ€ eftersom agressiva hanar hijackar andra hanars tillgÃ¥ng till kvinnor genom att dÃ¶da hanarna. Detta orsakar dinosaurierna eftersom stÃ¶rre muskelmassa och skarpare vapen Ã¤r bÃ¤ttre pÃ¥ att dÃ¶da rivalerna. Bland dinosaurierna fanns moder-avkomma-bandet, ditplacerad av evolutionen eftersom det var en fÃ¶rdel fÃ¶r mÃ¶drar att se sina barn Ã¶verleva till vuxenskap. Detta band muterade till att involvera flock-medlemmar eftersom en grupp sammarbetandes bÃ¤ttre kan vinna Ã¶ver individualister i brÃ¥k om vad som helst. NÃ¤sta stora steg var att nÃ¥gon kartlade flocken, i sin hjÃ¤rna, som en hierarki (upp-ned-axeln) med en lÃ¤ngtan efter att stÃ¥ hÃ¶gst upp i hierarkin. Denna kapitalistiska tÃ¤vlan mot toppen gjorde att hjÃ¤rnan vÃ¤xte sig stÃ¶rre â€“ stÃ¶rre minnesbank, mer detaljrika fÃ¶rutsÃ¤gelser och snabbare planering Ã¤r alla fÃ¶rdelar som kommer frÃ¥n att ha ett stÃ¶rre kortex.
Du har en komposit-sÃ¤ker sanning bestÃ¥endes av tvÃ¥ sÃ¤kra sanningar: du kan med sÃ¤kerhet sÃ¤ga att du tÃ¤nker (fÃ¶r att om du skulle bli lurad: att bli lurad Ã¤r en tankeprocess) och att du existerar (eftersom att bli lurad krÃ¤ver den som blir lurad). Jag tÃ¤nker och jag finns Ã¤r ett pÃ¥stÃ¥ende men tvÃ¥ sanningar. Du kan med sÃ¤kerhet pÃ¥stÃ¥ dig ha â€distinktionâ€ eftersom du har att gÃ¶ra med multipla separata entiteter (sÃ¥som â€jagâ€ och â€tankarâ€). Man kan sÃ¤ga, nÃ¤r man ser den sÃ¤kra sanningens â€jag tÃ¤nkerâ€ och â€jag existerarâ€, att avstÃ¥endet/mellanrummet mellan de tvÃ¥ idÃ©erna (tÃ¤nkare och tanke) Ã¤r distinktion. AvstÃ¥endet/mellanrummet som separarar tÃ¤nkare frÃ¥n tanke Ã¤r nÃ¶dvÃ¤ndigt fÃ¶r â€disktinktionâ€ att hÃ¤rledas som sÃ¤ker sanning fÃ¶ljandes ur nÃ¤sta logiska steg, med ursprunget av den originella primÃ¤ra sÃ¤kra sanningen.
Ã„r alla distinkta entiteter del av en singulÃ¤r verklighet om â€verklighetenâ€ Ã¤r definierad som â€det som allt Ã¤r del avâ€? Med andra ord: om vi ritar distinktion pÃ¥ vÃ¤nster sida av ett papper och anti-distinktion (distinktionÂ´s motsats: en ensam verklighet â€“ det som allt Ã¤r del av. Zoomandes ut maximalt) pÃ¥ hÃ¶ger sida av pappret, kan dÃ¥ distinktion representera hÃ¶ger sida av pappret dvs anti-distinktion? Hur skulle nÃ¥gon distinkt entitet kunna vara/representera motsatsen till vad representation/distinktion Ã¤r? Vilken representation som helst av anti-distinktion/verkligheten mÃ¥ste ha minst tre entiteter: tÃ¤nkare, mellanrummet mellan tÃ¤nkare och tanke, och tanke.
Separation/distinktion Ã¤r antaget i representation, vilket innebÃ¤r att anti-distinktion Ã¤r orepreserbart.
Hur vagt har universum/Gud definerat vad en representation Ã¤r dvs nÃ¤r en representation sker? VÃ¥ra hjÃ¤rnor anvÃ¤nder neuroner fÃ¶r att representera, men vad sÃ¤gs om â€“ istÃ¤llet fÃ¶r neuroner (oavsett om hjÃ¤rnor Ã¤r inblandade eller inte) â€“ universum lÃ¥ter vilket slumpmÃ¤ssigt valt objekt som helst lÃ¥ta sig sÃ¤gas, sÃ¥som neuroner sÃ¤gs, representera verkligheten? Universum har definierat â€representationâ€ oÃ¤ndligt vagt dvs uteslutandes hjÃ¤rnor sÃ¥ kan vilket slumpmÃ¤ssigt objekt som helst spotant bli/vara symbolen fÃ¶r all verklighet â€“ fÃ¶r att universum har definierat â€representeraâ€ oÃ¤ndligt vagt. Trots den oÃ¤ndligt vaga definitionen av vad som representerar vad, sÃ¥ gÃ¶r distinktions-anti-distinktions-oppositionen (linjen som separerar vÃ¤nster sida av pappret frÃ¥n hÃ¶ger sida; motsÃ¤ttningen mellan distinktion och anti-distinktion) att verkligheten Ã¤r orepresenterbar. Om verkligheten Ã¤r anti-distinktion dÃ¥ finns ingen distinktion (representation Ã¤r oundvikligen distinktion), trots universums oÃ¤ndligt vaga definition av â€representeraâ€, fÃ¥nga verkligheten. I representationer kan vi rÃ¤kna minst tre saker och det vi fÃ¶rsÃ¶ker representera Ã¤r en sak utan nÃ¥gonting utanfÃ¶r den. Faktumet att representationer innehÃ¥ller distinktion gÃ¶r att att fÃ¥nga verkligheten (allt som ett) omÃ¶jligt.
Vi kan ha oÃ¤ndligt mÃ¥nga eller oÃ¤ndligt innehÃ¥llsfulla/stora representationer/hypoteser â€“ sÃ¥som ett oÃ¤ndligt storleks-tids-diagram â€“ och genom att abstrakt peka till verkligheten, sÃ¥ gÃ¶r universums regel att ingenting representerar verkligheten trots universums oÃ¤ndligt vaga definition av â€representeraâ€ av oÃ¤ndligt mycket, gÃ¶r verkligheten orepresenterbar. Detta kan bara betyda en sak: verkligheten â€“ som vi kÃ¤nner som storlekar och tider (ett storleks-tids-diagram) â€“ Ã¤r oÃ¤ndligt. Det finns oÃ¤ndligt stort och oÃ¤ndligt litet med oÃ¤ndligt mycket dÃ¥tid och oÃ¤ndligt mycket framtid. Detta rektangulÃ¤ra storleks-tids-diagram dvs vÃ¥r vardagsvÃ¤rld av storlek-tid har oÃ¤ndligheter Ã¶verallt.
Energimassa i rumtid: ett i noll, existens i icke-existens, nÃ¥gonting i ingenting â€“ sÃ¥som definierats av E=mc
2
dÃ¤r c
2
stÃ¥r fÃ¶r ljusets hastighet (rum Ã¶ver tid dvs rumtid/noll/icke-existens) och E=m refererar till energimassa (existens, nÃ¥gonting, allt).
Distinktions-anti-distinktions-opposition: vi lever i en singulÃ¤r verklighet men vi ser multipla objekt.
En oÃ¤ndlig storleksskala.
De Ã¥vanstÃ¥ende tre idÃ©erna Ã¤r en existentiell teori (en teori som fÃ¶rklarar existensen av en reproduktiv form dvs evolutions bÃ¶rjan dvs vÃ¥r existens). Det Ã¤r modernt att anvÃ¤nda sig av tre likvÃ¤rdiga idÃ©er fÃ¶r att fÃ¶rklara ens existens â€“ alla tidigare existentiella teorier har antingen anvÃ¤nt en enda idÃ© (monoteism) eller en saga/myt (mÃ¥nga vardagliga (ej vetenskapliga/abstrakta) idÃ©er) fÃ¶r att fÃ¶rklara existens.
Den fÃ¶rutsÃ¤gande kvalitÃ©n som gÃ¶r denna existentiella teori till en vetenskaplig teori Ã¤r att den, baserat pÃ¥ en oÃ¤ndlig storleksskala av energimassarumtid och distinktions-anti-distinktions-opposition, fÃ¶rutsÃ¤ger att det i en oÃ¤ndlig storleksskala borde finnas en storlek dÃ¤r reproduktion (DNA) sker. Den existentiella teorin fÃ¶rutsÃ¤ger det fÃ¶rsta DNA:t, och frÃ¥n det fÃ¥r vi evolutionÃ¤r teori.
En annan fÃ¶rutsÃ¤gande kvalitÃ© Ã¤r att teorin fÃ¶rutsÃ¤ger att big bang borde varit
tÃ¤t
. A-priori begynnelsen av universum Ã¤r logiskt sett tomhet eftersom tomhet inte behÃ¶ver nÃ¥gon tidigare/fÃ¶religgande logiskt rÃ¤ttfÃ¤rdigande eftersom det ej existerar. I tom rumtid Ã¤r naturlagarna sanna, sÃ¥som naturlagarna som hanterar energimassa (sÃ¥som E=mc
2
), och dÃ¤rfÃ¶r bÃ¶rjar big bang oÃ¤ndligt tÃ¤t â€“ fÃ¶r att E=mc
2
Ã¤r lika sann samtidigt i de minsta storlekarna. De minsta tomma rymderna hade E=mc
2
som sann inom sig direkt nÃ¤r det fanns ingenting, vilket fÃ¶rutsÃ¤ger en tÃ¤t big bang. En region, inom event horizons gjorda av energimassa rusandes ivÃ¤g i >c (pga mÃ¶rk energi accelererandes kosmisk expansion) Ã¤r per definition â€ingentingâ€ i vilket E=mc
2
Ã¤r sann i de minsta utrymmena, vilket Ã¥stadkommer en big bang utom rÃ¤ckhÃ¥ll fÃ¶r de nÃ¤rmaste ( v = >c) energimassa. Ingenting (utom rÃ¤ckhÃ¥ll fÃ¶r nÃ¤rmaste energimassa fÃ¶r att den Ã¤r pÃ¥ vÃ¤g bortÃ¥t i >c) orsakas i centrumpunkten som har event horizons som grÃ¤ns lÃ¤ngst bort, vilket leder till en big bang (eftersom naturlagarna uppbringar energimassa i det tomma centrumet).
Det Ã¤r en stor historisk hÃ¤ndelse att det Ã¤ntligen finns ett ateistiskt argument i form av en universitetskurs: det Ã¤r en existentiell teori plus evolution som inte behÃ¶ver en personifierad gud fÃ¶r att fungera, utan dess pelare (oÃ¤ndlig storleksskala av energimassarumtid och distinktions-anti-distinktions-opposition) kan inte ha en personifierad gud tillagd till dem som en fjÃ¤rde pelare utan att teorin lÃ¥ter lÃ¶jlig. Det Ã¤r inte bara sÃ¥ att teorin inte behÃ¶ver en personifierad gud, utan att lÃ¤gga till en gud fÃ¶rstÃ¶r teorins minimalistiska rationellt kompletta skÃ¶nhet. Gudar fÃ¶rfular teorin. Teorins upptÃ¤ckt Ã¤r en stor historisk hÃ¤ndelse eftersom aldrig fÃ¶rr har en hel kurs (bÃ¶rjandes med sÃ¤ker sanning, gÃ¥endes genom den existentiella teorin och slutandes i evolution) lagts fram i ateismens intellektuella debatt, som ett argument mot en personifierad gud.
Anatomin i hjÃ¤rnan frÃ¥n att hÃ¶ra sÃ¤ker sanning (jag tÃ¤nker & jag finns) â€“ bÃ¶rjan av denna kurs â€“ skapar samma neuronala pathways / associationer mellan idÃ©er i varje person som hÃ¶r vet sÃ¤ker sanning. Det logiska steget till â€distinktionâ€ Ã¤r att notera, som meta-analys av den primÃ¤ra sÃ¤kra sanningen â€“ att man har mÃ¥nga idÃ©er (jag tÃ¤nker OCH jag finns) och att man kan ta den logiska vÃ¤gen till nÃ¤sta steg i kursen (distinktion finns). Att sedan motsÃ¤tta anti-distinktion med distinktion skapar den ofÃ¶rnimmbara â€“ â€mot resonâ€ (eftersom logik Ã¤r, i simpla mÃ¤nniskor, enbart visuell) â€“ slutsatsen att vi/distinktion inte kan se verkligheten/anti-distinktion. Distinktions-anti-distinktions-oppositionen Ã¤r svÃ¥rbegriplig fÃ¶r att den â€“ sÃ¥som formell logik eller matematik â€“ enbart anvÃ¤nder ord istÃ¤llet fÃ¶r bilder (den lingvistiska hjÃ¤rnhalvan istÃ¤llet fÃ¶r den visuella). Vi evolverade till att sÃ¤ga â€om jag kan se det sÃ¥ tror jag pÃ¥ detâ€ och det Ã¤r en god tumregel eftersom praktiska sekvenser hÃ¤ndelser kan verifieras som sanna eller osanna genom att visualisera dem. Men i denna filosofi: nej â€“ det mÃ¥ste vara lingvistiskt att vi fÃ¶rnekar oss sjÃ¤lva konceptet â€all verklighetâ€, vilket leder till slutsatsen att det finns mer till verkligheten Ã¤n nÃ¥gonting â€“ oavsett hur vagt universum definerat â€att representeraâ€ â€“ representerar. Detta tillÃ¤gger oÃ¤ndligt mÃ¥nga storlekar till vÃ¥r abstrakta stoorleksskala / storleks-tids-diagrammet; det gÃ¶r en rektangel (med storlek pÃ¥ y-axeln och tid pÃ¥ x-axeln) med oÃ¤ndlighetstecken i varje hÃ¶rn, som i sin tur blir en pelare i vÃ¥r personlig-gud-fÃ¶rnekande existentiella teori.
Att komma frÃ¥n sÃ¤ker sanningen genom enbart logiska steg (meta-analyser och motsÃ¤ttningsskapande av motsatser) till en existentiell teori som fÃ¶rutsÃ¤er evolutionen Ã¤r en stor historisk hÃ¤ndelse i ateismens historia.
I ett historiskt sammanhang Ã¤r anatomin (neurala anslutningar mellan idÃ©er och sekvenser logik) som skapas av denna kurs som ett paradigm-shifte in i en ny era av civilisation â€“ en era liknande den som finns pÃ¥ oÃ¤ndligt mÃ¥nga planeter vars vetenskap kommit lÃ¤ngre Ã¤n vÃ¥ra 4.5 miljarder Ã¥rs mittenpunkt i en vanlig vattenbÃ¤rande planets historia.
Evolution, genom att bÃ¶rja frÃ¥n â€en massa som samlar kringliggande massa till en liknande formâ€ kliver fram frÃ¥n den existentiella teorins oÃ¤ndliga storleksskala av energimassarumtid. Om vi antar att DNA Ã¤r replikationsmolekylen sÃ¥ kan vi ta steget till â€“ klivandes Ã¶ver hur cellvÃ¤ggar evolverade osv â€“ till att virus hijackar andras reproduktiva system. Detta â€“ i den universella inter-planetÃ¤ra rymdvarelsekulturen â€“ formuleras som, i bÃ¶cker av logik, som att de tre fÃ¶rsta reglerna uppkommer (liv/dÃ¶d, antalet avkomma har betydelse och â€det sker mutationer i varje generationsskifteâ€) och sedan att en fjÃ¤rde regel uppkommer (makt, med virus). Denna historia â€“ som i vÃ¥r kurs bÃ¶rjar frÃ¥n den fÃ¶rsta reproduktiva formen och slutar i att finslipa anatomin bakom makt i mÃ¤n â€“ Ã¤r visualiseringsbar som en grottmanna-historias narrativ likt dem vi evolverade till att se/hÃ¶ra. Vi kan proof-checka/validera historian genom att se den visuellt. Evolutions visuella natur Ã¤r i stark kontrast till den rent linguistiska/abstraka natur som den existentiella teorin har.
PÃ¥ tal om â€abstraktaâ€ beskrivningar dvs beskrivningar som gÃ¶r det vÃ¤ldigt klart fÃ¶r oss att vÃ¥r fÃ¶rstÃ¥else av universum bara Ã¤r en karta (en referens) och inte verkligheten i sig (tÃ¤nk pÃ¥ PlatoÂ´s och KantÂ´s grottmetafor och â€saken Ã¤r inte saken sjÃ¤lvâ€-filosofierâ€)â€¦ Storleksskalan av energimassarumtid, i storleken av kvantfysik har oss beskrivandes fotoner etc anvÃ¤ndandes bÃ¥de vÃ¥g-beskrivningar med fokus pÃ¥ lÃ¤ngder i rymd (dessa Ã¤r â€rumtids-beskrivningarâ€) OCH â€“ i vÃ¥r-partikel-dualitet â€“ energimassabeskrivningen dvs att energin i en foton Ã¤r dess fÃ¤rg. FÃ¤rg (sÃ¥som den uppfattas genom Ã¶gonen), vÃ¥g/rumtids-beskrivningen och partikel-energi/energimassa-beskrivningen Ã¤r alla legitimea beskrivningar av kvantfysiken. VÃ¥r fÃ¶rmÃ¥ga att beskriva vilken massa/vilket fenomen som helst med bÃ¥de energimassa- och rumtids-beskrivningar lÃ¶per genom hela storleksskalan. Du kan fÃ¶restÃ¤lla dig tvÃ¥ linjer â€“ en fÃ¶r energimassa och en fÃ¶r rumtid â€“ gÃ¥endes vertikalt genom alla bilder pÃ¥ storleks-axeln. TillÃ¤ggandes komplexitet pÃ¥ detta finns det tvÃ¥ linjer till â€“ tyngdlagen och elektromagnetism â€“ bÃ¥da gÃ¥endes lÃ¤ngs storleks-axeln, tyngdlagen har dess dualitet av energimassa- och rumtids-beskrivningar och elektromagnetism likasÃ¥ har desamma, dvs energimassa och rumtidsbeskrivningar. Tyngdlagen Ã¤r bÃ¥de Newtonisk â€massor dras till massorâ€ (energimassas fokus pÃ¥ massa) och Einsteinsk â€rumtids krÃ¶kningâ€ (rumtids fokus pÃ¥ rum) â€“ bÃ¥da beskrivningar Ã¤r korrekta.
Vi Ã¤r halvvÃ¤gs igenom en planets historia â€“ 4.5 miljarder Ã¥r har gÃ¥tt och 5 miljarder Ã¥terstÃ¥r. Teorin som du nu vet Ã¤r m.a.o. i kosmisk majoritet â€“ fler planeter har den Ã¤n har den inte (om det tar ungefÃ¤r hÃ¤lften av planetens historia att uppfinna den och om den kvarstÃ¥r under andra hÃ¤lften av planetens historia). De flesta andra planeter dvs majoriteten av rymdvarelser Ã¤r m.a.o. ideologiska anhÃ¤ngare av teorin. Sprid denna teori fÃ¶r att fÃ¥ bekrÃ¤ftelse av majoriteten trots att den bor ljusÃ¥r bort. Just nu lever 99.9% av jordens befolkning i eran av religioner â€“ sprid denna teori fÃ¶r att fÃ¥ slut pÃ¥ religiÃ¶sa krig samt terrorism sÃ¥som 9/11. VÃ¤rldsbilden (bilden/diagrammet som fÃ¶rklarar vÃ¤rlden) Ã¤r densamma i den kosmiska majoriteten.
Jag har jobbat i 10 Ã¥r fÃ¶r att Ã¥stadkomma teorin och som ensam om att kÃ¤nna till den Ã¤r det mitt ansvar att den sprids. Den framtida civilizationen i vilken alla har samma vÃ¤rldsbild hÃ¤nger dÃ¤rfÃ¶r pÃ¥ mig. Jag kÃ¤nner en unik mÃ¶jlighet att pÃ¥verka jordens framtid.

Can we
timetravel? We can proceed from era to era, just like dinosaurs preceded man and not vice versa â€“ its a universal sequence on any planet.
Heaven/karma instinctual but collides with main picture.
Water, primordial soup, proteins, dns strand. Single cell reproducing multiplying. Then 1 of these cells thought â€œill inject my own dna into some other cellâ€, hijack its reproductive system. Very beneficial. So first there were 3 rules: life n death, number of offspring matters and mutation in each generationshift, then with viruses came the 4th rule â€œpowerâ€ â€“ hijacking othersâ€™ reproductive system. Then theres an arms race between viruses and â€¦ â€œOur kind ofâ€ organism, so to mutate our immune system faster two genders arose. Then fights between males led to the dinosaurs. Then brains bonded into groups to fight individualists. Then capitalist power struggles within the group made the brain grow larger, weâ€™re good at planning and remembering things. Then we get to kingdoms. From the water puddle to the 21 st century. Those who proceed to the next era will live in a world where holy book-group bonds are weak and a universal courses group bond is the strongest, thus national wars or civilizational wars where identity is based on other than this science will be impossible. The planet has two future ways to go 60 years from now and one is better but needs some investment of time until everybody knows this course.
Theres a universal course/book thats on every advanced enough planet throughout the universe and at the regeneration of every universe. If you consider the entire corpus of human knowledge, youd find 3 rational starting points: certain truth, nothingness and that reality is one. Just like dinosaurs predate humans the first chapter with the 3 starting points predate the connecting of â€œi think n i exist, distinctionâ€ and â€œreality is one, antidistinction. Which leads to that there is more to reality than can be contemplated meaning that its infinite. Thats chaper 2: like multiplication and division are much higher levels of mathematics than adding and subtracting, chaper 2 is higher than the starting points in chapter 1.
â€”â€”â€”
If you want to be altruistic/selfless you can think about the millions of lives lost or living as refugees due to religious wars and group-loyalties based on ideology/religion. What if group-loyalty could be, for everyone, based on a single universal ideology? Then friendship ties, shared histories, well-mixing personalities and the like would form groups that donÂ´t have a religious mission/an ideological drive. When all ideologies are erased â€“ and religions too â€“ then simple biological mechanisms like common goals, shared interests and family ties bind us together â€“ and those kind of conglomerations are more likely to disintegrate than if there is a holy book or any ideological book as the binding principle between people. If ISIS would be educated then it would disintegrate and many civil wars break out among different families in Iraq/Syria â€“ but there would not be this major cleft between western&modern and holy&dogmatic.
If you want to be selfish like Ayn Rand: the upcoming world order / economy will be a meritocracy based on who advances or knows the most science. The ancient Chinese had a government where even the lowest peasant, if he passed a test in ConfusciousÂ´ teachings, could elevate himself higher in the society. Hierarchy is based on what is objectively to be admired; hierarchy is based on what infinitely many extraterrestrials in consensus have agreed upon be the criteria for how a humanÂ´s thoughts should be wired; hierarchy is based on the universeÂ´s disposition to reward those with the most accurate world-view or whom advance the pre-existing world-view and spread it to others â€“ the universe wants us choose to elevate in the hierarchy those whom appriciate the universe most fully, wholistically and most accurately. The old power-system based on money is upheld by banks and is based on present day humansÂ´ ties to the past. There will be an overlap between the old bank-based system for establishing VIP-status and the new economy which is a meritocracy based on science. If we want to be like planets ahead of us in the evolution of history, we ought to adapt the meritocracy-economy. After a few generations inherited money seems less legitimate than knowing or advancing science and by doing so wiring oneÂ´s cortex (flexible thinking part of the brain) as universally as possible (as much like the consensus among extraterrestrials is as possible).
There are three universal starting points for the universal course which will wire your brain universally. What I mean by â€œuniversalâ€ is that:
A) it is based on science meaning that it is retrievable from anywhere at any time; it is available universally unlike some time-specific language-specific location-specific holy-book-revalation.
B) universal means that it is how aliens/extraterrestrials sooner or later wire their brains. Sure: they can choose to live in a multi-worldviewical world but sooner or later the truth will conquer meaning that all various ideas among every tribe or nation will congregate (like a lens focuses many beams of light into one focal point) into a single set of ideas and prioritarizations â€“ a single world-view will emerge from the many. It is the identical world-view that all civilizing planets will congregate to/toward because science is universal. This congregating is as much of a universal step in evolution as that a planet with water will eventually have bacteria. Eventually everyone will know the course and the idea of this book. â€œWhat do you believe?â€ will no longer be a question because everyone has wired their cortexÂ´s ideas based on universal ideas/science.
â€”â€”â€“
Am I a muslim?
I have my size-time-diagram into which everything fits and this diagram being infinite gives an existential theory because:
â€“ sizes justify (are the cause of) one another, so thereÂ´s infinite justification.
â€“ time is infinite and our universe is observed to become nothingness in the future, and nothingness would be absurd if not for the fact that in the smallest spaces energymass is summoned because E=mc2 is a stable, constant law of nature.
â€“ there can only be separate distinct entities if distinction is counter-balanced and happens in non-distinction (a singular Reality). This point is much like the previous point of that only in nothingness can somethingness be summoned.
God, then, if we are to look for a meaning for the word, cannot be:
â€“ a specific object, size nor time within something infinitely larger
â€“ cannot, by definition, be apart from and â€œbeyondâ€ [that of which all is part] (Reality). Reality being an infinite size- and time-range of energymasspacetime is enough of an existential theory to explain us being here, the Big Bang, and the rest of the questions. God would, if claimed to be â€œbeyondâ€ the existential theory, be an unnecessary unproven assumption but more to the point: God would be â€œunrealâ€ if Reality is defined as we define it here. Such â€œbeyond Realityâ€-gods are unreal. WhatÂ´s more is that the phrase â€œAllah akbarâ€ (God is the biggest/greatest) wouldnÂ´t be true if Reality/[that of which all is part] is God plus Reality â€“ if [that of which all is part] has two major components, God and an energymasspacetime sizerange etc (the existential theory), then the sum of those two components is greater than God.
God, thus, obviously means Reallity by the definition of God being the greatest. God is then infinite. It makes sense to see people in awe over how much they can study, when they know thereÂ´s infinitely many fields of science which we do not have access to but which are logical and necessities for Reality to hold together. There being nothing absurd in an infinite size-range that resembles our known size-range (from quantum physics to the visible universe) is awesome and the highest you could possibly worship. This again proves that God is just a synonym for Reality/the existential theory.
Having studied all fields of science i.e. all sizes is the known sizerange, seeing how they all make up (justify) eachother (that itÂ´s just zooming in and zooming out), the wisdom that the sizerange is infinite (that there are infinitely many sizes making up one another) from the distinction (I think & I am logical path) and anti-distinction (that Reality is one) -thing, is the reason why we exist and God is not some size (sizes are not minds, except through evolution). Having studied all known sizes and knowing that the sizerange is infinite: it is an explanation to why weÂ´re here (akin to the Adam and Eve story or â€œGod created earth in 6 daysâ€ story) but it is not a revalation-giving thing â€“ the Quran wasnÂ´t written by God because God is not the kind of thing that writes/dictates stories. God being an infinite sizerange as thus our Creator is true, but the true way to get knowledge, rituals/pictoral representations and even guidance is through my work, not the work of the holy book-writers. The holy book writers might have said something true about God (just like I do in my work) â€“ but that is true of science textbooks moreso â€“ and they all said false things such as that God talks/gives revalations/authors holy books.
I can see the bronze-age marketing-teamÂ´s standpoint: people are more prone to follow dictates if theyÂ´re said to come from something/someone â€œhigher than humanâ€ i.e. a God or a ghost/spirit. Being invisible in as nonsense-a-way as some rituals are, is great for marketing. Everyone knows how humans thing â€“ theyÂ´re themselves human; we are only partly rational (a computer is rational) in what we think â€“ all our animal lusts bias or interrupt the thoughts that are as logical as they get, but theyÂ´re always going to be based against an evolutionary background just like the pitfall that my abstract diagram-including infinity-mentioning world-view is more like algebra than â€œwhat a world-view (context in which we are) should be thinking about that we lived for millions of years on the savannah, only needing to know (in oneÂ´s world-view) where the water-source is or whom stands under whom in the social hierarchy. WeÂ´ve mapped geographies, the use-based properties of objects/tools and personalities (and still do) for a gazillion years â€“ only with the advent of science SOME of us achieved higher i.e. used their evolved meager toolkit with all its biases to scetch out something like the theory of evolution in the 1800s. Looking at the evolution of [what we use our memory for]/how we map our surroundings/our world-view, before we mapped social relationships we mapped geographies. Before we mapped the functions of inventions (tools) our map only contained caveman tools (sharp stones and spears). The next step is to map oneÂ´s context as an infinite size-time-diagram (where size and time are really the same, but abstract thinking allows us to separate them into two distinct axises) or energymasspacetime (with itsÂ´ many laws of nature found in every school textbook in the world) and the distinction-antidistinction-
thing which feels so awkward/abstract that one wonders why one needs it as pillar 3 of the existential theory: the answer is: it wasnÂ´t invented (the words â€œI see a distinct objectâ€ or â€œwhy is there distinction?â€ werenÂ´t said in the same breath as â€œReality is oneâ€ or â€œenergymass and spacetime uniteâ€) until I did it in the 21st century). It might seem trivial to mention that separate entities exist in a singular Reality â€“ itÂ´s so obvious (thatÂ´s why no-one cared to make a big fuzz out of inventing it) but it makes the existential theory have three pillars (all of which can seem obvious) and not 4 â€“ thereÂ´s nothing more to add to the existential theory once youÂ´ve added the obvious â€œseparation in antidistinctionâ€-statement. I want to know how aliens (the infinitely many of them, steered by science toward an incommon path) think because its synonymous to finding a TRUE â€œkey to historyâ€ (Marx thought the key was equality, Hitler thought the key was racial superiority and a brutally competative relationship between races, Capitalism thinks itÂ´s freedom (less government), some might think they â€œkey to historyâ€ is to fund technological development). â€œHow aliens thinkâ€ is a shorthand way of saying â€œthe key to historyâ€ or â€œwhat will happen next/eventually and in hindsight seen as akin to the era of ancient grecoroman culture, the Industrial Revolution or the Digital revolution)â€. ItÂ´s what weÂ´re steered towards; itÂ´s the closest thing we get to divine guidance. ItÂ´s simply universal (drawn on science and practiced by infinitely many aliens) guidance/suggestions/
recommendations that we, as a species, can choose to promogate and thus â€œfollowâ€ or if weÂ´ll stick to multiculturalismÂ´s many -ismÂ´s like political quran-based islamism or christian-based â€œthe holy book gave me thisâ€-morality and codes of conduct. Some -ismÂ´s are dangerous (like quran-based politics and law) while some -ismÂ´s like christianity give too much credit to the -ism for simple human decency (in an age of extreme wealth globally). When my tummy is full IÂ´m a decent person â€“ I try to make money but IÂ´m not desparate after extreme wealth because I know that my caveman-brainÂ´s â€œneedâ€ for power (through status-symbols and freedom of space my environment to maximize the effectiveness of my hobby (writing)) wonÂ´t get satisfied no matter what external extravaganzas trigger my eyeballs, nor can people (socializing) make me much more satisfied than I am right now because all that is interesting and that there is to people is their brain â€“ and after a few weeks together thereÂ´ll be nothing I know nor any mental tool that I use that wonÂ´t, despite copyright, be in the hands of my friend: we wonÂ´t talk science (me teaching him/her) after all the science has been taught. I donÂ´t care to teach trivia so when I say â€œI teach SCIENCEâ€ I mean a finite thing: the existential theory plus something from each level of the known sizerange. Getting a P.hD from specializing on finding the structure of a rare protein only found in the feet of Amazonian forrest-mice is to put your eyes too close to the diagram; P.hDs for specializing/having a very narrow topic for oneÂ´s mind to engage in are for people who donÂ´t see the forest for the trees and care to rather look at one leaf of one tree instead of thinking about and seeing the forest as a whole. IÂ´m a forest person â€“ a leaf 10 cm from my eyes just bugs me. ThatÂ´s why there is a finite repertoire to what I call â€œscienceâ€ â€“ it takes a few days for me (my accomplishment/my work) to be fully understood and if repeated repetative. One only needs to know why/where one exists (the existential theory) once â€“ one canÂ´t forget it because we are made to remember the very context in which we live (here an evolutionary bias helps us: when someone explains â€œwhat the world isâ€ we remember it because â€œwhat the world wasâ€ in caveman days was the most useful thing the brain could do â€“ in fact we evolved such large brains because bigger brains remember better (can moreso map social relationships, successfull or unsuccesfull learning-experiences). We want to climb upwards in the hierarchy, find a mate, etc but all these wants and needs would be useless (theyÂ´d having nothing to work on) if it werenÂ´t for the map (of social relationships etc) that our brain is capable of remembering. We are inclined to remember existential theories because such knowledge about our place in the context was as useful as mapping whom is married to whom. This bias, by the way, is something holy book writers used to get people interested in their book. â€œGod created earth in 6 days (not 5)â€ is memorable because of our bias toward wanting to know about â€œcreation of the worldâ€ â€“ so the number â€œ6 daysâ€ is remembered too because it adds to the map that we then work on to seek power and other evolutionary benefits. ItÂ´s hard to make plans that have one reach evolutionary benefits if one does not know oneÂ´s environment/the external world. â€œ6 days for creating this place/worldâ€ adds to oneÂ´s map of the environment/place/external world. We have a bias for remembering it. Too bad the bronze-age holy books used this marketing trick (â€œhey, letÂ´s say something about their world (like the creation of it) because that would be something they remember!â€) to give pseudo- existential theories. The holy books made sales because not only do people want information about their context, people also want God to talk and interfere with day-to-day personal activites. Once you have a pseudo-explanation for how/why the world was created, youÂ´re free to add to that pseudo-explanation that â€œthe creator talksâ€. ItÂ´s impossible to add such a talking thing to my existential theory â€“ not only is it unnecessary (my theory works stand-alone) but it also contradicts basically every concept of my existential theory. The very definitions of energymasspacetime (meaning that God had nothingness as the canvas to paint on â€“ a nothingness that needs energymass and summons it because of the laws of nature inherent in that nothingness â€“ and chose to paint a beginning with as-dense-as-can-be (just like E=mc2 wouldÂ´ve created it because E=mc2 is true in the smallest spaces). Where was God when this happened? CouldnÂ´t have been energymass because energymass is only summoned once the universe becomes pure nothingness. If God is not energymass and energymass is existence â€“ then God doesnÂ´t exist / God is nothing. What doesnÂ´t exist or is nothing doesnÂ´t give revalations to men, doesnÂ´t care whom you sleep with, etc. Is God or GodÂ´s heaven a location in our size of infinite spacetime? In that case God is simply a far-away alien (which warrants questions about its evolution) but again â€“ it doesnÂ´t talk to us because of the distance and we wouldnÂ´t be too impressed even if an evolved God did talk to us (we are quite like it â€“ our science is the same, our world-view is the same). God is not a location in a size but is God a size? The sizerange is infinite (as proven by distinction not being able to see antidistinction) and thatÂ´d mean that thereÂ´s a creator to God (and that thing too has a creator, ad infinitum) IN THE SAME WAY as humans built cities or atoms make molecules. Again, if God is a size it warrantÂ´s the question: is God every location of that size or is God, like humans, in a location of that size? Whatever be the case, God still couldnÂ´t communicate with us. Since God fits neither in the context of energymasspacetime nor the context of the sizerange, a God-theory absolutely contradicts the true theory. What is said about God â€“ that God is the greatest â€“ makes only one â€œlocationâ€/notion in the existential theory correspond to a non-talking uncaring God: the theory itself (and more precisely Reality/[that of which all is part]) is the greatest. It certainly doesnÂ´t hear/talk nor give revalations because it comes as an infinite sizerange of energymasspacetime. When you tell this science, you can get to the point where you define Reality as â€œthat of which all is partâ€ and the greatest â€“ you can even get to antidistinction/the unrepresentability of Reality (fully, because we do represent some things) and people might still hope that a talking God can exist. But as soon as you mention the less abstract (the more abstract was that [that of which all is part cannot be observed]), the God-theory either surrenders or is in conflict with a/the existential theory which certainly is true (anyone can verify how the components of the theory fit together, make sense and explain everything). God as a synonym for Reality is boring â€“ why do we even have two words if we mean the same (scientific sizerange) thing.
If you assume that God is a synonym for Reality (which comes as an infinite sizescale, which in turn predicts a DNA-strand somewhere and voila: everything is explained), then I believe in your God. It doesnÂ´t appriciate my appriciation of it though, nor do rituals, following rules (made by men) etc please it. If I am to â€œshow my appriciation to itâ€ I do it by writing as I do right now â€“ thatÂ´s my worship of it: but IÂ´m under no illusion that this writing would please God by being logical (eventhough Reality itself is logical too â€“ so we have something incommon) â€“ me writing can be called worship but the only appriciating recipients of my writing are me and readers of my text. Whatever I write about Reality/God doesnÂ´t please God (because God is not a thing that listens, likes worship by others and other human needs) â€“ whatever worshippers do, I hope they do it for themselves and for other humans because no-one else is able to care or comprehend the worship. I would do the muslim prayer if I felt that that kind of discipline would benefit me (and a few times I did get a good feeling from going to the mosque and being among worshippers). ItÂ´s so easy to adapt to the customs of oneÂ´s peers (and especially oneÂ´s superiors, if one believes that there are those) that my attitude toward worship/ritual is â€œwhen in Rome, do like the romans (if you or others gain something out of it)â€. The world is complex â€“ I could have the same attitude toward the beliefs of islam: that IÂ´ll just say that something is through eventhough it obviously isnÂ´t because it contradicts, say, a talking holy book-writing God. Could I make myself believe that something talkative is God? The belief disintegrates and I get the foul feeling of that IÂ´ve used my valuable memory to note down a lie everytime I would think just one step/association further from the belief itself. I can believe (in anything) but analyzing it even the smallest amount will make me disbelieve it. But when youÂ´re in the mood of not analyzing â€“ like when one is having a panic attack on oneÂ´s death-bed â€“ IÂ´ll be (extremely) simplistic and do what some people seem to always do: â€œbelieve (in something that breaks down when analyzed)â€. What confuses me is that some people believe all the time â€“ they seem perfectly sane but they believe in a talking, scripture-giving God (that doesnÂ´t fit anywhere in the existential theory). Do they need comfort (from untruth) all the time? It seems like theyÂ´re trying to argue their position, though. A perplexing phenomenon at first glance but when you consider that theyÂ´re uneducated about my existential theory, any theory will do (even a talking God-theory). I am not hateful of it when I see it in other people â€“ I see it as humorous/ridicilous â€“ but when it binds people together (to form what in essence is an army) and thereÂ´s many of them (10 000 religions/â€armiesâ€) the worldÂ´s got a problem. Binding people together through their shared scripture and their belief that something impossible is true is bad because groups tend to be more violent than individualists â€“ especially if their holy text 1) seems to bind billions of people to their army (morale-strength amplification in a group is the root of violence), and 2) preaches violence/disrespect (many holy books are xenophobic and eager to create an â€œus vs. themâ€-social dynamic). If the holy book is taken seriously (if it canÂ´t be thrown in the trash) then we have bronze-age xenophobia (based on who likes the book and who doesnÂ´t) creeping into the modern day, and we also have artificial bonding/loyalty â€“ we basically get groups who are hostile (or more disrespectful) toward anyone who doesnÂ´t see the point (â€œthereÂ´s a talking Godâ€) theyÂ´re promoting. ItÂ´s such an easily fixable problem: if you read my work you simply cannot believe in a talking God â€“ my professional role is that you can give me ANY individual and I can â€œconvertâ€ him/her into not believing in a talking God. Whether this person will follow his or her groupÂ´s rituals or codes of conduct, though, is up to them â€“ itÂ´s sheer peer pressure.
The â€œus vs. themâ€ â€œwe are a big groupâ€ (and especially) â€œwe should convert the whole world so that they use their precious memory for knowing nonsense like we doâ€ are such great reasons for violence â€“ and of course itÂ´s fixable because what these people lack is education: only where there is no theory, can a pseudo-theory take root. Only where there is no argument/debate/science can â€œGod talksâ€ seem like legitimate truth. This means that much of the worldÂ´s violence is due to a lack of education (about the big questions i.e. what I talk about). Sure: some religions can be interpreted to say â€œkill the infidelsâ€ or some other explicit declaration of war â€“ but itÂ´s hard for a religion to survive if it constantly preaces fighting (it must have more clever tactics than that â€“ but it does tend to seek world-dominion). IÂ´m not so worried that someone reads the Quran and thinks â€œIÂ´ll help the [unbelieves in the QuranÂ´s talking God] to get to hell faster, because the Quran says that thatÂ´s where they belongâ€. I am worried about that the Quran (or any holy book) is the glue that binds people together. Religion is the last glue before we enter an era where obviously arbitrary things like nationalism or language makes strangers feel more familiar with eachother. Nation and language arenÂ´t taken that seriously â€“ nor should religion be, but it is. This binding-effect that holy books have is what makes ISIS / the taliban etc so hard to defeat â€“ they think, not only that they have an all-seeing revalation-giving God on their side, but they also have the exact same copy of a book that a billion people have. They feel strong (with their, seemingly to them, superior numbers). Obviously ISIS underestimated the ability of the Quran to draw in arab nations into the fight over Iraq & Syria â€“ the modern world simply leaned on the fact that ISIS are not muslims because they interpret the bronze-age ramble wrong. But ISIS / the taliban is still a factor â€“ the quran binds too many people together in certain areas of the world â€“ violence is caused, due to the binding-effect, the â€œmoral superiorityâ€-effect, the â€œpower in numbers and billions of people read the Quranâ€-effect etc (all these effects are there even if you skip the parts about the talking God who word for word said the Quran) make men as prone to violence as anything can make them: theyÂ´re a group with an â€œus vs. themâ€ dogma & feeling and they feel like they have power in numbers. Add to that the frustration over having to finance an own home before one can ejaculate. Those circumstances can make the group take up arms and â€œsend the infidels where they belongâ€. Following the commandments frustrates, the whole notion of â€œletÂ´s all prioritize this text highest (our favorite book) so that weÂ´re bound togetherâ€ and that the text itself can be interpreted as violent all are a breeding-ground for trouble â€“ and when youÂ´re in the trouble that the text creates, you are not in the state of mind to do the internal debate necessary to disprove a talking God and thus make your whole way of life become something that you either do as meaningless fun or donÂ´t do because no-one cares. But just as some people want to become professional soccer players and some atheists do zen-meditation, humans (by personal preference) want hobbies, to take up a discipline, to do something that adds, say, pride to their life. I donÂ´t personally care about soccer and I donÂ´t feel pride from doing any ritual, but I can definitely see that others take the muslim prayers like an athlete takes their sport. ItÂ´s possible to find out the objective truth about whether these prayers â€œplease God or notâ€ (by, like IÂ´ve done in this text, disproving all kinds of false Gods and making the real God more mundane and not a talker). Rituals donÂ´t please Reality/â€the energymasspacetime sizerangeâ€ because it is not a thing that gets pleased â€“ itÂ´s like trying to please a rock. You do the prayers because you enjoy the pride/hobby for its own sake â€“ like someone doing sports likes his/her sport. Pleasing a rock/God to get to a â€œheavenâ€ (which too doesnÂ´t fit into the true existential theory) is stupid unless itÂ´s akin to a hobby/sport where you do it for doing itÂ´s sake. Same thing with the â€œheaven hates hamâ€-thing â€“ when you know enough science (enough = what IÂ´ve written so far in this text) youÂ´ll realize that the whole ham-prohibition is man-made (from the bronze age) and linked to some pre-scientific nonsense from-the-horseÂ´s-mouth-
statement (canÂ´t say rationale because itÂ´s dogma). If you (and secondarily your peers) are dedicated to nonsense (whether it be sports, stamp-collecting, memorizing capitals or not eating pork), then do it if it does something good like prove to yourself (and others) that you have a strong discipline (even though your effort is misdirected toward nonsense). I can invent a ritual and do it every day, and maybe IÂ´d feel pride over that I can keep to a schedule of nonsense, but I would never claim the theory that there is a talking God, and by extention I wouldnÂ´t say that that ficticious talker prohibited ham. The mundane action must be differentiated from the logical argument. Ham-prohibitions and talking Gods are artifacts that belong in the past â€“ modern white A4-paper is too beautiful for someone to write something as erroneous as â€œthere is a talking Godâ€ on it. But as IÂ´m writing this, people are dying because religion binds them together (and frustrates them, and boosts their war-morale in many ways). My work can cause a civil war within ISIS â€“ a civil rift so permiating that only family ties, friendships and common goals (to get money, not to spread islam) can keep people together in groups. Once my existential theory is known there will still be crime and instability in Iraq, Syria and Afghanistan, but the evil deeds will only be committed by groups of 2-3 people â€“ not 20 000 of them. The binding effect of the Quran can most clearly be seen in that internet-propaganda made Quran-readers from the USA and Europe go fight in Syria â€“ everyone wants a group and itÂ´s totally human to assume that knowing the same book will be enough for a bond to be as strong as one wants it to be.
Right now â€œmy workâ€ is 9 proper texts and a few videos. They all talk about the same thing (which can be formulated as: IÂ´ll say as much as I can about things IÂ´ve never heard anyone else say (and IÂ´ve seen the best professors in the world teaching truths)). To cause a rift in the taliban/ISIS and stop the war by making group-bonding (around a holy book) problematic/impossible, my whole â€œworkâ€ doesnÂ´t need to be dropped as propaganda books on top of ISIS and the taliban. ItÂ´s enough that the news headlines say that â€œa correct all-explaining existential theory has been found â€“ religions in crysisâ€ or that enough people know my theory so that a multitude of youtube videos are made where, in a sentence or two, the presenter goes off-topic and mentions why we exist / something from my theory. Having understood it once makes it impossible to forget â€“ having understood it once makes group-bonding over religion (which fuels ISIS/the taliban/etc) impossible. If the world could just take 20 minutes of itsÂ´ time to spend on explaining/teaching/arguing my work/theory, then the war on terror would be over â€“ otherwise it will persist as long as people have no actual, logical theory about their existence and thus believe in bronze-age marketing tricks.
â€”â€”-
The theory of evolution begins with the first reproducing shape. It was a shape that assembled surrounding mass into a similar shape. The existential theory predicts the existence of infinitely many such shapes. What inevitable becomes true when you have reproduction is that some die and some survive (life and death), that the number of offspring that shape make matters and that there is mutations over time. This is true about the shapeÂ´s offspring: some will die and some will survive, the number of offspring they make matters and the offspring can be different from the original shape. These three rules / laws of nature were inactive before the first reproduction occurred. The next main event was that one of these shapes found that if it injected its DNA into other shapesÂ´ reproductive mechanism, it exploited principle number two: that the number of offspring matters. It was the first virus: it hijacked othersÂ´ reproduction. The rule / law of nature that came into play with this event was that â€œpowerâ€ matters: hijacking othersÂ´ reproductive mechanism gives evolutionary benefits. Now weÂ´ve listed the four main rules that govern evolutionary theory: first came the three first, and then came the forth: power. The next main event â€“ to guard against viruses taking over all life / reproductive mechanisms â€“ was that an immune system evolved to protect against virusÂ´ hijack attempts. This required multicellularism. Just like immune systems prompt/require multicellularism, immune systems prompt/require multigenderedism: to win in the arms race against quickly mutating viruses two genders arose to amplify the mutations to the immune system. Mixing genes from two genders creates a more mutated immune system, which can keep ahead in the arms race against quickly-mutating viruses â€œtryingâ€ to mutate to bypass any immune system. The next main event is that one of these multicellular organisms â€“ a fish or worm â€“ of the male gender mutated to be agressive and defeat other males in battle. He wouldÂ´ve gotten access to many more females than his non-agressive counter-parts. This too can be called â€œpowerâ€ because the agressive male hijacks other maleÂ´s access to females by killing the males. This prompts the dinosaurs because larger muscle mass and shaper weaponry is better at killing off competitors. Amongst the dinosaurs there was the mother-offspring bond, placed there by evolution for the evolutionary benefits a mother gets from seeing an offspring survive to adulthood. This bond mutated to involve flock-members because a group working together out-competes any individualists when fighting over anything. The next main event was that someone mapped the flock, in his brain, as a hierarchy (up-down-axis) with the longing to dominate peers.

Dude, evolution has me try to maximize evolutionary benefits using my plans; im always thinking at full speed and pain drives that thinking. And i know for certain that all this pain is meaningless. Its a suicide recipe but what prevents me from suicide is the natural strength that stems from being the pinnacle of beasts who all have survived for generations.

New book 2017
Chapter 1:
What problem does this solve?
This solves a problem that becomes most visible 60 years from now when sea-levels rise, the economy goes into permanent decline and oil ends. ThatÂ´s when humans start to fight (and belong in world-view-based groups to do so). While the economy is still rising the clashes are few and far between â€“ Afghanistan, Syria, ISISÂ´ world-wide terror attacks (mainly muslim world-views clashing with tolerant world-views). When the economy starts declining thereÂ´ll naturally be more friction between groups, and groups are made up of world-views (people identify as in a group based on world-view).
Advancing the scientific world-view to the level where it explains our origin and thus invades religious intellectual turf, solves the problem of world-views colliding as war.
Chapter 2:
Certain truth â€“ I think & I am
You have a composite certain truth consisting of two certain truths: you can claim as certain that you think (because if you were being fooled: being fooled is thinking) and that you exist (because being fooled requires the one who is fooled to be there). I think and I exist is one statement but two truths. You can certainly claim to have â€œdistinctionâ€ because youÂ´re dealing with multiple separate distinct entities (such as â€œIâ€ and â€œthoughtâ€). One could put it, while seeing the certain truths â€œI thinkâ€ and â€œI existâ€, that the space between the two notions (thinker and thought) is the hallmark of distinction. The distance separating thinker from thought we can recognize as necessary for â€œdistinctionâ€ to be concluded as a certain truth arising, in a next logical step, from the original primary certain truth.
Everyone agrees they they themselves exist, because if one would get fooled in everyone one can be fooled in then one would exist there anyway and be fooled. So one knows that one exists. Then one also knows that one thinks because â€œto get fooledâ€ is a thought-process. Thus we have two things: I think and I exist. And the distinction between them: and on the flipside of the paper we have the opposite of that: anti-distinction, and this can also be called â€œthat of which all is partâ€/Reality. And since we are in the distinction-side of the paper when we see something; when we see something there is distinction between us and that thing. Thus we cannot represent or see that which is on the other side of the paper i.e. that of which all is part / Reality. Nothing can represent â€“ because it is distinct â€“ Reality. So whatever which is distinct cannotâ€¦ whatever that is observed or represented is distinct and therefore is notâ€¦ therefore does not represent Reality / â€œthat of which all is partâ€. So we have distinction and anti-distinction as opposing poles.
You have a certain truth which everyone in the whole world agrees upon. You think and you exist since if you were being fooled by an almighty demon youÂ´d still both think and exist. Then there are two things i.e. distinction. All is part of a single reality which is anti-distinction, there are no separate parts: reality is one. If we put distinction on the left side of the paper and anti-distinction on the right side then (we) distinction cannot see that of which all is part because â€œto seeâ€ is â€œto representâ€ and then one uses something to refer to reality. There is nothing outside reality which can refer to reality but instead reality is defined as â€œthat of which all is partâ€ and then there is nothing that can refer to all of reality. The opposition between the two sides of the paper (distinction & anti-distinction) makes reality as â€œthat of which all is partâ€-anti-distinction non-representable because representation always involves distinction. What we see, for example, is just parts of reality. The hypotheses can be infinitely much so there is infinitely much to reality. Sizes and times, that is. In the existential theory (â€œwhy we existâ€) there, thus, is an infinite size-range with time, energymass in spacetime (everything and nothing intertwined like in the E=mc2 equation â€“ energy equals mass times, well â€“ spacetime; multiplication is what unites energymass with spacetime). Then we have distinction and anti-distinction: separate things but all is part of a single reality. The existential theory with its three pillars, that is an infinite sizerange, energymasspacetime and distinction-anti-distinction-opposition, predicts that there should be a tiny piece of DNA which copies itself.
Then thereÂ´s another kind of revelation that got respect. Descartes who lived in the 1600s got respect, fame and was invited to live with the Queen of Sweden because he had gotten an idea which certainly told us something true. Revelations can either be con menÂ´s statements like they were from ape-man and forward, or they can actually claim something which is verifyably true. Descartes, propably having his mind overcrowded by the masses of revelations that had accumulated to his time, asked: â€œwhat would be true if all my statements were false?â€. What would remain if I tossed all my knowledge and ideas into the trash? Are we stuck with countless unverifyable statements, some contradicting eachother, not knowing which ones are true and which ones are not? Obviously not since statements about architecture are obviously true since they build houses, while contradictory statements do not. So Descartes dared to throw all his knowledge in the trash to see what remained. He found certain truth: that he exists â€“ because even if he was wrong or was being fooled in everything he thought to be true, thereÂ´d still be a â€œheâ€ there. He certainly exists no matter what. Same thing goes for thoughts: being wrong or being fooled is a thinking-process so even if he was wrong or was being fooled in everything he thought, thereÂ´d still be thought.
Socrates: So he figured out that he thinks and he exists.
God: These are not one statement â€“ they are two.
Socrates: What does that mean?
God: IÂ´ll tell you later â€“ just agree with me that there is distinction between thinker and thought â€“ that the statements are two. ItÂ´s building on certain truth, and itÂ´s possible to build a wholeâ€¦ whatever it is that â€œsaves the worldâ€ from the coming economic decline by having everyone build on certain truth until the God-debate is settled. Remembering â€œdistinctionâ€ (between thinker and thought) will prevent the horror-scenario of large-scale future wars between people group-bound by religions, and instead â€“ since everyone built a whole world-view on certain truth â€“ have a more stable decline in the future. â€œDistinctionâ€ i.e. remembering that there are two certain truths (thinker and thought) is a step on the way toward a plan that will save humanity from destroying itself as much as it would if we didnÂ´t build our world-views on certain truth.
Plato: So after an era of â€œrevelationâ€-revelations invented by anyone for whatever purpose, coming from DarwinÂ´s ape-manÂ´s revelations, Descartes, in the 1600s, invented a revelation â€“ certain truth: I think and I exist â€“ which got him invited to the Queen of Sweden for the rest of his life. People have always liked revelations and even verifyable truth-claims like DescartesÂ´ get respect.
God: I have set it as true that each one of you humans can verify in your own mindÂ´s eye that you do certainly exist and that there certainly is thought â€“ and thus there is distinction.
Darwin: Distinction is an abstract word. That two objects are separate/different from one another is one of those notions and ape-man never made into language â€“ there was never the evolutionary need to talk about â€œdistinctionâ€. Yes: one could say that one banana is different from another (and one wants the bigger one), but to have Distinction exist stand-alone as a distinct notion is abstract thinking and we are not evolved to do that. For millions of years the caveman word for â€œdistinctionâ€ was only used in a sentance â€“ not stand-alone as in â€œdistinction certainly exists because thinker and thought are both certain truthsâ€.
Chapter 3:
Distinction-antidistinction-opposition
The first proof for that the size-time-diagram is infinite is distinctionÂ´s (our) inability to see/represent anti-distinction.
Chapter 4:
Maximum size?
The second prooof for that the size-time-diagram is infinite is that if we imagine a partless anti-distinction then it has no distinction as in a â€œmaximumâ€ or â€œminimumâ€ size, i.e. the size-range is infinite.
Chapter 5:
Infinite size-time-diagram
Chapter 6:
Existential theoryÂ´s 3 pillars
Chapter 7:
Prediction of DNA

Everyone agrees on that reality is one. Because itÂ´s one nothing can represent it, because the representer too should be part of reality. That means that there is a size-time-diagram which is infinite. And thatÂ´s why we exist. Everyone agrees on this eventhough we are distinct unique individuals. We have this world-view incommon, with extraterrestrials too.

The ultimate argument against God i.e. a new existential theory
You know for certain that you think and that you exist because in the event that you were being fooled (or threw all your knowledge in the trash) you would "think" because being fooled is a thinking-process and you would exist because "being fooled" implies that there is someone there who is being fooled
There is distinction between thinker and thought. There are separate entities. "Distinction" is one logical step from certain truth.
All is part of a single reality - "all as one" is anti-distinction (the opposite of distinction).
Can thinker or thought see anti-distinction? Can distinction represent anti-distinction? The opposites cannot catch one another.
Is there thus distinction in the form of a maximum or minimum size (or time) in anti-distinction? No, therefore size and time are infinite.
Another proof for that the size-range is infinite is that the universe defined "represents" infinitely vaguely, meaning that this
text
- in the eyes of God - is attempting to represent "that of which all is part"/reality as one, but fails because representation is distinction and reality is anti-distinction.
At every size you see energymass (existence) and spacetime (non-existence) as intertwined, as in E=mc
2
(where c
2
is spacetime). Because E=mc
2
is true in every size (including the smallest ones) the Big Bang gets summoned as dense when there is nothingness. Telescope observations show that nothingness is coming in the future again.
An infinite size-range of energymasspacetime and distinction-anti-distinction explains our existence better than God.
A size-time diagram with evolution originating in the middle of the known size-range.
You know for certain that you think and that you exist because even if an almighty demon was fooling you in everything you can possibly be fooled in, the fooling itself is a thought-process and therefore you know that thought exists (you think), and for you to be fooled you have to exist and therefore you know "I exist". Being fooled is thinking and a thinker is necessary for there to be someone to be fooled. So you know: no matter what, you think and you exist. Those are two things, right? TheyÂ´re both part of the same brain and the thought-process can become the analytical toolkit/thinker, but still we recognize that there are distinct entities - there is distinction. This can also be called separation. What is distinctionÂ´s opposite, anti-distinction? ItÂ´s one reality; that of which all is part; itÂ´s one and realityÂ´s definition in the dictionary is that all is part of it. If we write distinction (thinker and thought) on the left side of the paper and anti-distinction (reality; that of which all is part; one) on the right side of the paper - can the left side see the right side? No, because of opposition between distinction and anti-distinction. Because of there always being an observer (a thinker) and thus distinction in every observation and thus anti-distinction canÂ´t be represented/seen.
The brain evolved to deal with natural occurances - there was never an event in history where something invisible was to be contemplated and dealt with. Thus we seem to assume that the thought-process went wrong when we say that distinction/us canÂ´t see anti-distinction/reality. But the thought-process didnÂ´t go wrong: all that it means is that there is more to reality than can be represented. Regardless of how vaguely "represents" is defined, say a coffee cup - regardless of brains being involved - is assumed to try to represent that of which all is part, then anti-dinstinction - distinction - opposition (the opposition between distinction and itÂ´s opposite) makes the representation incorrect. We can ask if there in an anti-distinct "thing" is a maximum size and thus distinction? No. Likewise, another proof for that the size-range is infinite is that we do sense something (our everyday world) and can make hypotheses ad infinitum, and yet nothing represent
s ALL OF reality. Reality i.e. s
ize-time thus is infinite.
The infinite size-range is one pillar in the existential theory. Another pillar is energymass and spacetime being opposites but intertwined as in E=mc
2
(where c
2
refers to a speed which is space over time: spacetime). Multiplication joins energymass together with spacetime; nothing together with something/everything; existence together with non-existence. Why is there existence the shape of my body? Without going into the historical answer, one can explain it by saying that the body is something in (intertwined with) nothing, of a size in an infinite size-range (where the relationship between any two sizes (or objects of two sizes) i
s that they make sense of i.e. j
ustify one another). Then there too, as a third pillar, is distinction-an
ti-distinction-opposition i.e. w
e live in a single (not plural) reality but we see distinct/separate entities such as thinker and thought.
Speaking of spacetime, spacetime is the logical starting point for the time-based existential theory.
Nothingness (empty space) needs n
o prior justification nor reason to exist, because it doesnÂ´t exist. In it, however
, laws of nature are true i.e. i
t is not irrational / anti-logical, and among the many laws of nature there are those, including E=mc
2
, which mention energymass.
Could energymass be "mentioned" without it existing? If yes, it would be absurd / anti-logical. Why would reality mention things that never exist? But since laws of nature are firm and because of our rule "what is mentioned must exist or must be summoned" we get, wherever (in the smallest spaces) that E=mc
2
is mentioned, existence and thus dense existence: a big bang. The fact that galaxies are speeding away acceleratingly from one another leads to nothingness in the future, and with the middleman "laws of nature" again energymass is summoned as dense as can be. No time-delay between nothingness - laws of nature - energymass but as soon as a bordered (by event horizons which are determined by the finite speed of light) region becomes nothingness, a big bang occurs and eventually becomes nothingness bordered by event horizons again. This is the time-wise description of why energymass (which exists intertwined with spacetime as in E=mc
2
) starts dense and becomes nothingness, and repeats.
All of the above is a rival theory to "God created earth in 6 days and rested on the 7th". It is unintuitive because it deals with things we didnÂ´t have to deal with in evolution: invisible energymasspacetime/reality/anti-distinction as a part of reasoning. It also has a multi-reason cause for our existence: a time-wise rationale involving the beginning and end of the big bang combined with a 3-pillar existential theory which justifies size and energymass. It is abstract/scientific but canÂ´t be reduced into simpler terms. ItÂ´s the lowest common denominator that everyone can believe in (regardless of religion).
How many is reality? One. How many is Allah? One. Can anything completely represent reality? No. Can anything completely represent Allah? No. Is reality the greatest (if all is part of it)? Yes. Is â€œAllah akbarâ€? Yes. Reality and Allah have these three things incommon â€“ so maybe reality is synonymous with Allah?
How vaguely has reality defined â€to representâ€?
Infinitely vaguely â€“ anything can represent anything.
Is the representation/representer reality or Allah?
No.
Can anything represent that of which all is part?
No.
Then the size-time-diagram is infinite i.e. nothing represents reality. How many is it? How many is Allah? 1.
Did it sayâ€¦, or did it wri
te a book?
This disproves Allah writing the Quran.
Again: how much of reality can be represented by, say, a painting? The whole of it?
No, the whole of reality cannot be represented. Just like Allah canÂ´t be captured in a picture/word.
We can have hypotheses â€“ how many hypotheses can we have?
If reality is sizes & times, energymass and spacetime then the square-shaped size-time-diagram with energymasspacetime in each coordinate is the universal way to represent all there is to represent.
Does it write books? No, it is not of such authorship-kind nature.
â€œGod said to Muhammed word by wordâ€¦â€ is thus a false or at most metaphorical statement.
â€œYou have to do rituals in order not to go to hell, and in heaven you get 72 virginsâ€ is by the same logic also a false claim.
There are three alternatives as the foundation for this logic â€“ can you think of a 4
th
one?
1: Reality is a synonym for Allah
2: or Allah doesnÂ´t exist
3: or there are 72 virgins (not an alternative because reality is not of the nature, because it is size-time-energymasspacetime, to write books).
In addition to the square size-time diagram with infinity symbols in each of itÂ´s corners, and the evolutionary triangle which designates that life becomes more complex as time goes on
(the triangle originates at the central size of the known size-range), there is the following brain diagram:
You have a composite certain truth consisting of two certain truths: you can claim as certain that you think (because if you were being fooled: being fooled is thinking) and that you exist (because being fooled requires the one who is fooled to be there). I think and I exist is one statement but two truths. You can certainly claim to have â€œdistinctionâ€ because youÂ´re dealing
with multiple separate distinct entities (such as â€œIâ€ and â€œthoughtâ€). One could put it, while seeing the certain truths â€œI thinkâ€ and â€œI existâ€, that the space between the two notions (thinker and thought) is the hallmark of distinction. The distance separating thinker from thought we can recognize as necessary for â€œdistinctionâ€ to be concluded as a certain truth arising, in a next logical step, from the original primary certain truth.
Are all distinct entities part of a single reality if â€œrealityâ€ is defined as â€œthat of which all is partâ€? In other words: if we draw distinction on the left side of a paper and anti-distinction (distinctionÂ´s opposite: a singular reality â€“ that of which all is part. Zooming out summarizing maximally) on the right side of the paper, then can distinction represent the right side of the paper i.e. anti-distinction? How could some distinct entities depict the very opposite of what representation/distinction is? Any depiction/representation of anti-distinction/reality has at least three entities: thinker, space between thinker and thought, and thought. Separation/distinction is inherent in representation, thus anti-distinction is unrepresentable.
How vaguely has the universe/God defined what a representation is i.e. when a representation occurs? Our brains use neurons to represent, but what if â€“ instead of neurons (regardless of brains) â€“ the universe wills that any random object can be said to, as neurons do, represent reality? The universe has defined â€œrepresentationâ€ infinitely vaguely i.e. disregarding brains, any random object spontaneously is the symbol standing for all of reality â€“ because the universe defines â€œrepresentsâ€ infinitely vaguely. Despite the infinitely vague definition of what represents what, distinction-anti-distinction-opposition (the line separating the left side of the paper from the right side; the countering of distinction with anti-distinction) means that reality is not representable. If reality is anti-distinction then no distinction (representation is inherently distinction) can even, despite an infinitely vague definition of â€œrepresentsâ€, capture reality.
In
representations we can count at least three things and what weÂ´re trying to capture is one thing with nothing outside it. The fact that representations contain distinction makes capturing reality (all is one) impossible.
We can have infinitely many or infinitely large/substancefull representations/hypotheses â€“ such as an infinite size-time-diagram â€“ and though abstractly accurately pointing to reality, the universeÂ´s rule that nothing represents reality despite infinitely vaguely allowed representations of infinitely much, makes reality unrepresentable. This can only mean one thing: reality â€“ which we know as sizes and times (a size-time-diagram) â€“ is infinite. ThereÂ´s infinitely large and infinitely small with infinitely much past and infinitely much future. This square-shaped size-time-diagram i.e. our everyday experience of size-time has infinities all-over the place.
Energymass in spacetime: one in zero, existence in non-existence, something in nothing â€“ as defined by E=mc
2
where c
2
stands for speed (distance over time i.e. spacetime/zero/non-existence) and E=m referring to energymass (existence, something, all).
Distinction-anti-distinction-opposition: we live in a singular reality but we see multiple objects.
An infinite size-range.
The above three ideas are an existential theory (a theory which explains the existence of a reproducing shape and thus the dawn of evolution and thus our existence). It is modern to utilize three equal ideas to explain oneÂ´s existence â€“ all previous existential theories used either a single idea (monotheism) or a saga (multiple mundane (not very scientific/abstract) ideas) to explain existence.
The predictive quality that makes this existential theory a scientific theory is that it, basing it off an infinite size-range of energymasspacetime and distinction-anti-distinction-opposition, predicts that in an infinite size-range there ought to be a size where reproduction occurs. The existential theory predicts the first DNA, and from there we get to the evolutionary theory.
Another predictive quality is that the theory predicts a
dense
Big Bang. The a priori beginning of the universe logically is emptiness because emptiness doesnÂ´t need any prior logical justification for its existence because it doesnÂ´t exist. In emptiness laws of nature are true, such as the laws pointing toward and handleing energymass (like E=mc
2
), and thus the Big Bang begins infinitely dense because E=mc
2
is equally true simultaneously in the smallest of spaces. Tiny empty spaces having E=mc
2
be true in them simultaneously and directly as there was nothingness predicts a dense Big Bang. A region, contained within event horizons made out of energymasses speeding away at >c (due to dark energy causing accelerating cosmic expansion), is by definition â€œnothingâ€ in which E=mc
2
being true in the tiniest spaces summons a dense big bang out of reach of the closest (v = >c) energymass. Nothingness (out of reach for the closest energymasses because they are speeding away at >c) is summoned in the central point with event horizons as the furthest away border, causing Big Bang (due to laws of nature summoning energymass in the empty center).
The theory of evolution begins with the first reproducing shape. It was a shape that assembled surrounding mass into a similar shape. The existential theory predicts the existence of infinitely many such shapes. What inevitable becomes true when you have reproduction is that some die and some survive (life and death), that the number of offspring that shape make matters and that there is mutations over time. This is true about the shapeÂ´s offspring: some will die and some will survive, the number of offspring they make matters and the offspring can be different from the original shape. These three rules / laws of nature were inactive before the first reproduction occurred. The next main event was that one of these shapes found that if it injected its DNA into other shapesÂ´ reproductive mechanism, it exploited principle number two: that the number of offspring matters. It was the first virus: it hijacked othersÂ´ reproduction. The rule / law of nature that came into play with this event was that "power" matters: hijacking othersÂ´ reproductive mechanism gives evolutionary benefits. Now weÂ´ve listed the four main rules that govern evolutionary theory: first came the three first, and then came the forth: power. The next main event - to guard against viruses taking over all life / reproductive mechanisms - was that an immune system evolved to protect against virusÂ´ hijack attempts. This required multicellularism. Just like immune systems prompt/require multicellularism, immune systems prompt/require multigenderedism: to win in the arms race against quickly mutating viruses two genders arose to amplify the mutations to the immune system. Mixing genes from two genders creates a more mutated immune system, which can keep ahead in the arms race against quickly-mutating viruses "trying" to mutate to bypass any immune system. The next main event is that one of these multicellular organisms - a fish or worm - of the male gender mutated to be ag
g
ressive and defeat other males in battle. He wouldÂ´ve gotten access to many more females than his non-ag
g
ressive counter-parts. This too can be called "power" because the ag
g
ressive male hijacks other maleÂ´s access to females by killing the males. This prompts the dinosaurs because larger muscle mass and shaper weaponry is better at killing off competitors. Amongst the dinosaurs there was the mother-offspring bond, placed there by evolution for the evolutionary benefits a mother gets from seeing an offspring survive to adulthood. This bond mutated to involve flock-members because a group working together out-competes any individualists when fighting over anything. The next main event was that someone mapped the flock, in his brain, as a hierarchy (up-down-axis) with the longing to
be the top of the hierarchy. This capitalist striving for
the top made brains grew larger â€“ larger memory-banks, more accurate predictions and faster planning are all advantages coming
from a larger cortex.
Power lead men to accumulate resources â€“ the very resources females needed for their children. Females care most about their children because they pass on their genes, so in finding a male they aim for loyalty plus status/power/placement in the hierarchy. Females think a lot about how others â€“ especially suitors â€“ perceive them and therefore males evolved the subconscious mechanism, to keep womenâ€™sÂ´ attention, to push-pull i.e. to, in one coherent fluent conversation, both say negative feedback about the woman and positive feedback.
It is a major historical event that there finally is an atheistic argument that is sh
aped like a university course: i
t is an existential theory plus evolution which not only doesnÂ´t need a personified god to function, but the pillars (infinite sizerange of energymasspacetime and distinction-anti-distinction-opposition) canÂ´t have a personified god added to them as a 4th pillar without the theory sounding ridicilous. Not only does the theory not need a personified god but adding a god destroys the minimalistic rationally complete beauty of the theory. Gods uglify the theory. The dawn of the theory is a major historical event because never before has an entire course (beginning with certain truth, going through the existential theory and ending in evolution) been laid out in the intellectual debate of atheism, as an argument against a personified god.
The anatomy in the brain from hearing certain truth (I think & I am) - the beginning of the course - creates the same neuronal pathways / associations between ideas in every single person who knows certain truth. The logical step to "distinction" is noting, as a meta-analysis of the primary certain truth, that one has many ideas (I think AND I am) and that one can take logical pathways to the next step in the course (distinction exists). Then juxtaposing anti-distinction with distinction creates the unseeable - "defying reason" (because reason is, in simple people, only visual) - conclusion that we/distinction cannot see reality/anti-distinction. The distinction-anti-distinction-opposition is hard to grasp because it - like formal logic or math - uses words instead of pictures (the linguistic brainhalf rather than the visual one). We evolved to be like "if I see it I believe it" and that was a good heuristic (rule of thumb) because practical sequences of events can be verified as true or untrue by visualizing them. But in this philosophy: no - it has to be linguistic that we deny ourselves the concept "all of reality", leading to the conclusion that there is more to reality than anything - however vaguely the universe has defined "represent" - can represent. This adds infinitely many sizes to our abstract size-range / size-time-diagram; it makes a square (with size on the y-axis and time on the x-axis) with infinity symbols in each corner, which in turn becomes a pillar in our personified-god-denying existential theory.
To come from certain truth, through mere logical steps (meta-analyses and juxtaposition of opposites), to an existential theory which predicts evolution is a major historical event in the history of atheism.
In a historical context the anatomy (neural connections between ideas and sequences of logic) created by this course is like a paradigm-shift into a new era of earth society - an era similar to
that existent on infinitely many other planets who have come further than our midway-mark in a regular water-bearing planetÂ´s history.
Evolution, by beginning with "a mass that can assemble surrounding mass into a similar shape" steps forth from the existential theoryÂ´s infinite size-range of energymasspacetime. Assuming DNA is the replication-molecule, we can step - skipping over how cell walls evolved etc - to the fact that viruses mutate to hijack othersÂ´ reproductive system. This - in this universal inter-planetary extraterrestrial culture - is formulated, in books of logic, as first three rules arising (life/death, number of offspring matters and "there is mutation in each generation-shift") and then a forth rule arising (power, with viruses). This story - which in our course begins from a first reproducing shape and ends with finessing the anatomy of power in men - is visualizable like the caveman story-telling narratives we evolved to hear/see. We can proof-check its validity/possibility by following the narrative visually. The visual nature of evolution is in stark contrast to the purely linguistic/abstract nature of the existential theory.
Speaking o
f "abstract" descriptions i.e. d
escriptions that make it very clear to us that our understanding of the universe is a mere map (a reference) and not reality itself (mind you of PlatoÂ´s or KantÂ´s cave-metaphor and "the thing is not the thing itself" -philosophies)... The size-range of energymasspacetime,
at the size of quantum physics
has us describe photons etc using both the wave-description which focu
s
es on lengths of space (this is the "spacetime description") AND - in wave-particle duality - the energymass description that the energy of a photon is its color. Color (as perceived through the eyes), wave/spacetime-description and particle-energy/energymass-description all are valid descriptors of quantum particles. This ability of ours to describe any mass/phenomenon using both energymass- and spacetime-descriptions runs throughout the entire size-range. You can imagine two lines - one representing energymass and the other representing spacetime - running vertically through the pictures on the size-axis. Adding complexity to this, there is likewise two lines - gravity and electromagnetism - both running through the size-axis, gravity having itÂ´s duality of energymass and spacetime descriptions and electromagnetism too having both, in every level of the size-range, energymass and spacetime descriptions. Gravity is both Newtonian "masses pulling toward masses" (energymassÂ´ focus on mass) and Einsteinian "curvature of spacetime" (spacetimeÂ´s focus on space) - both descriptors are accurate.
From having read this book, the following should now be understandable:
Certain truth leads to the conclusion â€œdistinctionâ€, and simultaneously warrants an anti-distinction defined as â€œthat of which all is partâ€. The opposition between distinction and anti-distinction â€“ despite â€œrepresentationâ€ being ubiquitous (infinitely vaguely defined) â€“ together with the â€œmax size?â€-question asked in anti-distinction â€“ supports the fact that reality i.e. size-time is infinite. This then becomes our pillar in our existential theory that moves God away from a creator role. The two other pillars are energimasspacetime (found in E=mc
2
) and the opposition that we live in a singular reality yet see multiple things. From the middle of the known size-range (which itself is part of the infinite size-range) comes the tip of a triangle which symbolizes evolution. From evolution, then, comes the brain diagram with dopamine & serotonin across the visual and linguistic brainhalves, and a lower box which is our 3-category emotional repertoire; the most common 4 emotions in our idle society being power-hungryness (how to elevate oneself in the socioeconomic hierarchy if one is a man; and for females itÂ´s mapping the status-hierarchy of men in their social group as to find them
differently attractive), expanding oneÂ´s world-view, planning sex and planning resource-gathering/work. This makes for a multi-symbol diagram involving the existential theoryÂ´s three pillars holding up the square-triangle-brain (size-time-diagram, evolution, brain) diagram.
Certain truth is or leads to distinction, which itself â€“ as all distinct things are â€“ is part of anti-distinction. This is like saying obvious things about the reality/everyday world in front of us: such as that size is infinite and that it is something in nothing. All this, in turn, leads us to draw a square: a size-time diagram with infinity-symbols in all 4 corners. From the middle of the known size-range, then, comes a triangle â€“ evolution â€“ which ends up in the brain with serotonine, dopamine, two brainhalves, a cortex and an emotional repertoire (upper- and lower box). In the emotional repertoire there are 4 idle emotions, among them â€œseeking powerâ€ â€“ power here is defined as outcompeting other males (if oneself is male) in a status competition, but the principle of diminishing other malesÂ´ reproductive capabilities happened at several stages in evolution: males fighting males (growing bigger to become dinosaurs) or viruses hijacking reproductive mechanisms of single-celled organisms. The search for power thus has led to brain-size growing (when competing for upwardness in hierarchies) but also things like T-rexÂ´s claws or the 1918 flu â€“ not to mention war.
Previous atheists have moved God from a place where do intervenes in everyday life using miracles, to a God that set everything in motion but then doesnÂ´t intervene. My philosophy places God as a bum who watches a skyscraper get built â€“ the bum then gets praised for the skyscraper getting built even though the bum didnÂ´t contribute anything: at most he watched as other mechanisms got everything done. Or God is a football fan who cheers at the players but doesnÂ´t himself contribute to making goals. Natural mechanisms create the world â€“ no need to praise God.
We are half-way in a planetÂ´s history â€“ 4.5 billion years have passed and 5 billion remain. The theory you now know is, in other words, in cosmic majority â€“ more planets have it than not (if it takes approximately half of a planetÂ´s history to invent it and if it remains true for the rest of the planetÂ´s history). Most other planets i.e. the majority of extraterrestrials are ideological adherents of the theory. Spread this theory to get approval of the majority even though it lives light-years away. Currently 99.9% of the worldÂ´s population lives in the era of religions â€“ spread this theory to end religious wars and terrorism like 9/11. The world-view (the view/diagrams that explain the world) is the same in the cosmic majority.
IÂ´ve worked 10 years to invent this theory and as alone bearing it itÂ´s my responsibility that it spreads. The future civilization in which everyone has the same world-view thus is dependent on me. I feel a
unique ability to influence earthÂ´s future.
You, as one who has partaken of this rare knowledge, should also feel a responsibility about spreading it to change the world.
IÂ´ve talked about the emotional repertoire in the brain-diagram. If we were to genetically engineer (DNA-manipulate) a next generation, we would A) give it an incredible sense of humor and knowledge so it could entertain us, and/or B) make it a super-happy retard â€“ retarded because positive emotions donÂ´t motivate â€“ they pacify â€“ so super-happy is equal to looking like a mongoloid; needs and wants and everything that drives us is painful â€“ pain motivates while super-happiness pacifies. We would, by creating these DNA-engineered emotional repertoires (to accomplish the dual
goal of incredible happiness and incredible entertainers/comedians/philosophers), be doing something that is done on other planets â€“ these are universal engineering goals.
You know that gold plate we sent up into space for aliens to find? It had etched on it images of man, some music, some other picturesâ€¦ We didnÂ´t send up the diagram discussed in this book. If the aliens see the gold plate we did send up, theyÂ´ll read between the lines â€“ seeing that there is no universal diagram â€“ and conclude that: â€œon earth they still believe in godsâ€.
You know how most people dedicate a large part of their lives to religion? Once they understand my tattoo (diagram) theyÂ´ll ask themselves: â€œwhat the hell have I been praying to?â€ It resembles a tiny needle popping a big balloon.
If this book goes mainstream, the future becomes so interesting that one forgets oneÂ´s everyday problems.
Interesting important things relieve
anxiety
(especially when they contain humor like a universal tattoo).
Nazis were friends with Nazis, communists were friends with communists, USA was friends with USA, when jihadists meet they share the same ideology and thus bond quickly. My theory/ideology/religion-replacer is empathy-increasing.
The more things people agree upon the better.
In the diagram/tattoo there are about 16 â€œlinesâ€ (hundreds if we consider the emotional repertoire being drawn the same on other planets). The sport is to draw as many universal lines as possible â€“ drawn from science so they can be drawn from science anywhere in the infinite universe.
God is a war-motivator. They say â€œthere are no atheists in trenchholesâ€. You need a bit of God to do war.
ItÂ´s hard to be an atheist warrior. My book, by disproving god, thus makes motivation for war less.
Gods contribute nothing â€“ one will have the full human experience-repertoire without gods.
Rather no direction than the wrong direction â€“ gods only contribute to war; itÂ´s better to be tolerantly caveman, uncaring of ideologies/world-views, than to be religious.
It seems mean to say that â€œitÂ´s their fault that religious wars keep on going â€“ those that wonÂ´t studyâ€, but itÂ´s good marketing.
Accomplices.
This book is worth you reading if it solves (or significantly helps) a major problem.
It is good marketing of my book to outline
the problem that I solve here.
USA is better than war, right? USA has poor folks committing crime â€“ thatÂ´s far better than nations waring. I move the problem from a macro-scale where nations fight eachother over oil, to an individualistic/family-based/friendship-based micro-scale where everyone feels as ideological/religious comrades â€“ empathy and friendship-buildingly sharing the knowledge of this book. I can get everyone to have the same ideology/religion-replacement so that thereÂ´ll be no war over the oil that has made us rich enough to not witness babies dying every day. Nations, races, ideologies, religions â€“ large groups â€“ makes the difference between war and crime. I solve the problems of macro-war and the friendship problem once everyone knows my diagrams. The post-oil decline isnÂ´t going to be pretty but we can take all measures to alleviate it â€“ spread this book.
If God is defined as â€œthe reason for existenceâ€ and I present a complete existential theory as a diagram, and I tattoo the diagram on my arm, is my
tattoo
then God? No, just a symbol for the reason for existence. One can tattoo an explanatory model for existence and God has during thousands of years been defined as the cause for existence.
My philosophy is to be real (to have an accurate concept of reality) but talking to religious people is like drifting away into a novel â€“ itÂ´s fiction but it (in some people) is beautiful. The greatest qualm I have about publishing my science is that it strips away the beautiful fiction novel as well as the hideous terrorism.
Why is it that the correct existential theory (which presumably should only be a big bang-type theory) inevitably is an arguemtn against imaginary friends/lords? Couldnâ€™t God exist without having created the universe? God certainly didnÂ´t create the universe but religious people could have an imaginary friend despite that. A powerless god â€“ a pet god.
We have about 60 years to publish this science because after that the world economy starts going downhill and what today is â€œjustâ€ a trillion dollar thing (dealing with religion in the middle east) will become a clash of civilizations (as long as a billion people believe in the revealed word of Muhammed and form an anti-atheist group based on that). But imagine if I become known as the one who ended islam â€“ during the past 2 decades islam has cost USA 6 trillion dollars. If I end religious war for good and get a piece of the pie (some of what the world will save by not having religious war)â€¦
Ending religion might even have unforeseen consequences like if religion is a major brain-drain or if having a uniting global ideology spurs friendship so much so that the world needs less military spending.
If religion is ended tomorrow the USA can reduce its military spending because the main trouble-zone (the religious middle east) is gone (converted to atheism). A large US military in a world full of conflict is as powerful as a small US military in a world where my science is mainstream. The world is messed up because it lacks my science and that warrants a big US military presence. If my science was known the US would need as much global military reach as is needed between California and Oregon. 1 billion people reading a holy book which says that atheists should be killed warrants a big military presence.
A much smaller US military is sufficient to quell all atheist conflicts.
Every fool has said â€œif all people would think just like me thereÂ´d be world-peaceâ€ but I have the opportunity to say that for real because all people need to do is learn a page of new science.

Texten bÃ¶rjar med sÃ¤ker sanning, sedan gÃ¥r den till att fÃ¶rklara varfÃ¶r nÃ¥gonting existerar istÃ¤llet fÃ¶r ingenting (den existentiella teorin â€“ varfÃ¶r vi existerar), sedan gÃ¥r den till evolutionÃ¤r teori vilket fÃ¶rutsÃ¤gs av den existentiella teorin. Den evolutionÃ¤ra teorin fÃ¶rklarar vardagsfenomen.
Du vet med sÃ¤kerhet att du tÃ¤nker och att du existerar eftersom om du skulle bliva lurad av en allsmÃ¤ktig demon som fÃ¶rsÃ¶ker lura dig i allt du kan bli lurad i, sÃ¥ Ã¤r lurendrejeriet i sig en tanke-process och dÃ¤rfÃ¶r vet du att tankar existerar (du tÃ¤nker). FÃ¶r att du ska bli lurad sÃ¥ mÃ¥ste du existera och dÃ¤rfÃ¶r vet du â€jag existerarâ€. Att bli lurad Ã¤r en tankeprocess och tÃ¤nkaren Ã¤r nÃ¶dvÃ¤ndig fÃ¶r att det ska finnas nÃ¥gon som blir lurad. SÃ¥ du vet: oavsett vad sÃ¥ tÃ¤nker du och existerar du. Ã…vanstÃ¥ende Ã¤r tvÃ¥ saker, eller hur? De Ã¤r bÃ¥da del av samma hjÃ¤rna och samma tankeprocess kan bli ens analytiska verktygssats/tÃ¤nkare, men vi erkÃ¤nner Ã¤ndÃ¥ att det finns distinkta entiteter â€“ att det finns distinktion. Detta kan ocksÃ¥ kallas separation. Vad Ã¤r distinktions motsats, anti-distinktion? Det Ã¤r en verklighet; det som allt Ã¤r del av; den Ã¤r en och dess definition i ordboken Ã¤r att allt Ã¤r del av den. Om vi skriver distinktion (tÃ¤nkare och tanke) pÃ¥ vÃ¤nster sida av ett papper och anti-distinktion (verkligheten; det som allt Ã¤r del av; en) pÃ¥ hÃ¶ger sida av pappret â€“ kan den vÃ¤nstra sidan se den hÃ¶gra sidan? Nej, fÃ¶r att oppositionen mellan distinktion och anti-distinktion. Det finns alltid en observerare (tÃ¤nkaren) och dÃ¤rmed distinktion i varje observation och dÃ¤rmed kan anti-distinktion ej representeras/ses.
HjÃ¤rnan evolverade fÃ¶r att hantera naturliga fenomen â€“ det fanns aldrig ett scenario i historien dÃ¥ nÃ¥gonting osynligt behÃ¶vde hanteras och betÃ¤nkas. DÃ¤rfÃ¶r antar vi att tanke-processen blev fel nÃ¤r vi sÃ¤ger att distinktion/vi inte kan se anti-distinktion/verkligheten. Men tankeprocessen gick inte fel: allt det betyder Ã¤r att det finns mer till verkligheten Ã¤n kan representeras. Oavsett hur vagt â€representerasâ€ Ã¤r definierat, lÃ¥t oss sÃ¤ga att en kaffekopp â€“ oavsett om hjÃ¤rnor Ã¤r involverade eller inte â€“ antas fÃ¶rsÃ¶ka representera det som allt Ã¤r del av, dÃ¥ gÃ¶r anti-distinktions-distinktions-oppositionen (motsÃ¤ttningen mellan distinktion och dess motsats) att representationen Ã¤r inkorrekt. Vi kan frÃ¥ga om en anti-distinkt â€sakâ€ har en maximumstorlek och dÃ¤rmed distinktion? Nej. PÃ¥ samma not Ã¤r ett annat bevis fÃ¶r att storleksskalan Ã¤r oÃ¤ndlig Ã¤r att vi ser nÃ¥gonting (vÃ¥r vardagsvÃ¤rld) samt kan gÃ¶ra hypoteser ad infinitum, och Ã¤ndÃ¥ representerar ingenting ALL verklighet. Verkligheten dvs storlek-tid Ã¤r dÃ¤rfÃ¶r oÃ¤ndligt.
En oÃ¤ndlig storleksskala Ã¤r en av pelarna i den existentiella teorin. En annan pelare Ã¤r att energimassa och rumtid Ã¤r motsatser (opposition) men sammanflÃ¤tade sÃ¥som i E=mc
2
(dÃ¤r c
2
hÃ¤nvisar till en hastighet dvs rum Ã¶ver tid: rumtid). Multiplikationen sammanfÃ¶r energimassa tillsammans med rumtid; ingenting tillsammans med nÃ¥gonting/allting; existens tillsammans med icke-existens. VarfÃ¶r finns det existens i form av min kropp? Utan att gÃ¥ in i det historiska svaret sÃ¥ kan man fÃ¶rklara det genom att sÃ¤ga att kroppen Ã¤r nÃ¥gonting i (sammanflÃ¤tat med) ingenting, av en storlek i en oÃ¤ndlig storleks-skala (dÃ¤r relationen mellan vilka tvÃ¥ storlekar som helst (eller objekt av tvÃ¥ storlekar) Ã¤r att de Ã¤r fÃ¶rklaringen till varandra dvs rÃ¤ttfÃ¤rdigar varandra. Sedan finns det ocksÃ¥, som tredje pelare, distinktions-anti-distinktions-opposition dvs vi lever i en singular (ej plural) verklighet men ser distinkta/separata entiteter sÃ¥som tÃ¤nkare och tanke.
PÃ¥ tal om rumtid, rumtid Ã¤r den logiska startpunkten fÃ¶r den tidsbaserade existentiella teorin. Ingenting (tom rumtid) behÃ¶ver inget inledande/tidigare rÃ¤ttfÃ¤rdigande eller anledning att existera, fÃ¶r att det existerar inte. I den, hursomhelst, Ã¤r naturlagarna sanna dvs den Ã¤r inte irrationell / anti-logisk, och bland naturlagarna finns de som, inklusive E=mc
2
, som nÃ¤mner energimassa. Skulle energimassa kunna â€nÃ¤mnasâ€ utan att det skulle existera? Om â€jaâ€ sÃ¥ skulle det vara absurt / anti-logiskt. VarfÃ¶r skulle verkligheten nÃ¤mna saker som aldrig existerar? Eftersom naturlagarna Ã¤r strikta och tack vare vÃ¥r regel â€det som nÃ¤mns mÃ¥ste existera eller uppstÃ¥â€ sÃ¥ fÃ¥r vi, varÃ¤n (i de minsta storlekarna) dÃ¤r E=mc
2
nÃ¤mns, sÃ¥ finns existens och dÃ¤rfÃ¶r en tÃ¤t big bang. Faktumet att galaxer rusar ivÃ¤g accelererandes frÃ¥n varandra leder till ingenting (tom rymd) i framtiden, och med mellanhanden â€naturlagarâ€ sÃ¥ uppstÃ¥r energimassa igen sÃ¥ tÃ¤t som den kan vara. Ingen tids-delay mellan ingenting â€“ naturlagar â€“ energimassa men sÃ¥ snart en begrÃ¤nsad (av event-horizons som bestÃ¤ms av ljuset Ã¤ndliga hastighet) region blir ingenting/tomrum, sÃ¥ uppstÃ¥r en big bang som sedan genom kosmisk expansion blir ingenting igen, som sedan blir tomrum och en ny big bang igen. Detta Ã¤r den tidsmÃ¤ssiga beskrivningen om varfÃ¶r energimassa (som existerar sammanflÃ¤tad med rumtid sÃ¥som i E=mc
2
) bÃ¶rjar tÃ¤t och blir ingenting, och sedan repetitation.
Det Ã¥vanstÃ¥ende Ã¤r en rivalteori till â€Gud skapade jorden pÃ¥ 6 dagar och vilade pÃ¥ den sjundeâ€. Den Ã¤r inte intuitiv eftersom den har att gÃ¶ra med saker som vi inte hade att gÃ¶ra med under evolutionen: osynliga energimassarumtid/verkligheten/anti-distinktion som del av vÃ¥rt resonemang. Den har ocksÃ¥ en multi-anledning orsak fÃ¶r vÃ¥r existens: en tidsvis rationale involverandes bÃ¶rjan och slutet pÃ¥ big bang, kombinerad med en 3-pelares existentiell teori som rÃ¤ttfÃ¤rdigar storlek och energimassa. Den Ã¤r abstrakt/vetenskaplig men kan inte reduceras till simplare termer. Det Ã¤r den minsta gemensamma nÃ¤mnaren som alla kan tro pÃ¥ (oavsett religion).
Hur vagt har verkligheten definerat â€att representeraâ€?
OÃ¤ndligt vagt â€“ vad som helst kan representera vad som helst.
Ã„r representationen/representÃ¶ren verkligheten eller Allah?
Nej.
Kan nÃ¥gonting representera det som allt Ã¤r del av?
Nej.
DÃ¥ Ã¤r storleks-tids-diagrammet oÃ¤ndligt dvs inget representerar verkligheten. Hur mÃ¥nga Ã¤r den? Hur mÃ¥nga Ã¤r Allah? 1.
Sa denâ€¦, eller skrev den en bok?
Detta motbevisar att Allah skrev en bok.
Igen: hur mycket av verkligheten kan representeras av, sÃ¤g, en mÃ¥lning? All den?
Nej, hela verkligheten kan ej representeras. Precis som Allah inte kan fÃ¥ngas i ett ord/en bild.
Vi kan ha hypoteser â€“ hur mÃ¥nga hypoteser kan vi ha?
Om verkligheten Ã¤r storlekar och tider, energimassa och rumtid sÃ¥ Ã¤r det rektangulÃ¤ra storleks-tids-diagrammet med energimassarumtid i varje koordinat det universella sÃ¤ttet att representera allt som finns att representera.
Skriver den bÃ¶cker? Nej, den Ã¤r inte av fÃ¶rfattarnatur.
â€Gud sa till Muhammed ord fÃ¶r ordâ€¦â€ Ã¤r alltsÃ¥ ett falskt eller som mest ett metaforiskt pÃ¥stÃ¥ende.
â€Du mÃ¥ste gÃ¶ra ritualer fÃ¶r att inte hamna i helvetet, och i himmelen fÃ¥r du 72 oskulderâ€ Ã¤r med samma logik ocksÃ¥ ett falskt pÃ¥stÃ¥ende.
Det finns tre alternativ som fundament fÃ¶r denna logik â€“ kan du tÃ¤nka ut ett fjÃ¤rde?
1: Verkligheten Ã¤r ett synonym fÃ¶r Allah,
2: eller sÃ¥ finns inte Allah
3: eller sÃ¥ finns 72 oskulder (ej ett alternativ eftersom verkligheten inte Ã¤r av den naturen, dÃ¥ den Ã¤r storleks-tids-energimassarumtid, att den skriver bÃ¶cker).
Som tillÃ¤gg till det rektangulÃ¤ra storleks-tids-diagrammet med oÃ¤ndlighetssymboler i varje hÃ¶rn, och den evolutionÃ¤ra triangeln som representerar att livet blev mer komplext ju mer tiden gick (triangelns spets har sitt ursprung i mittersta storleken i den kÃ¤nda storleksskalan), finns fÃ¶ljande hjÃ¤rn-diagram:
Den existentiella teorin med dess tre pelare, dvs en oÃ¤ndlig storleksskala, energimassarumtid och distinktions-anti-distinktions-opposition, fÃ¶rutsÃ¤ger att det borde finnas en liten bit DNA som kopierar sig.
Evolutionsteorin bÃ¶rjar med den fÃ¶rsta reproducerande formen. Det var en form som samlande kringliggande massa till en liknande form. Den existentiella teorin fÃ¶rutsÃ¤ger existensen av oÃ¤ndligt mÃ¥nga sÃ¥dana former. Det som oundvikligen blir sant nÃ¤r man har reproduktion Ã¤r att vissa dÃ¶r medan andra Ã¶verlever (liv och dÃ¶d), att antalet avkomma/kopior formen gÃ¶r har betydelse och att det finns mutationer Ã¶ver tid. FÃ¶ljande Ã¤r sant om formens avkomma: vissa dÃ¶r medan andra Ã¶verlever, antalet avkomma har betydelse och avkomman Ã¤r annorlunda frÃ¥n originalformen. Dessa tre regler / naturlagar var inaktiva innan den fÃ¶rsta reproduktionen skedde. NÃ¤sta stora steg var nÃ¤r ett av dessa former mÃ¶jliggjorde fÃ¶r sig sjÃ¤lv att injicera sitt DNA in i andra formers reproduktiva mekanism, vilket utnyttjade princip nr 2: att antalet avkomma har betydelse. Det var det fÃ¶rsta viruset: den hijackade andras reproduktion. Regeln / naturlagen som kom i spel i.om. denna hÃ¤ndelse var att â€maktâ€ har betydelse: att hijacka andras reproduktiva mekanism ger evolutionÃ¤ra fÃ¶rdelar. Nu har vi lagt fram de fyra huvudregelerna som Ã¤r evolutionsteori: fÃ¶rst kom de tre fÃ¶rsta reglerna, sedan kom den fjÃ¤rde: makt. NÃ¤sta stora hÃ¤ndelse â€“ fÃ¶r att skydda mot att virus hijackar alla reproduktiva system â€“ var att ett immunsystem evolverade fÃ¶r att skydda mot virus hijacks-fÃ¶rsÃ¶k. Detta behÃ¶vde multicellulÃ¤rism. Precis som immunsystem krÃ¤ver multicellularism, sÃ¥ behÃ¶ver immunsystem multikÃ¶nadhet: fÃ¶r att vinna i kampen dÃ¤r virus muterar fÃ¶r att kringgÃ¥ immunsystem sÃ¥ behÃ¶ver immunsystemet ocksÃ¥ maximalt med mutation. Att mixa gener frÃ¥n tvÃ¥ kÃ¶n skapar ett mer muterat immunsystem, vilket hÃ¥ller ut i kampen mot virus dÃ¤r virus â€fÃ¶rsÃ¶kerâ€ mutera sig runt immunsystemet. Den nÃ¤sta stora hÃ¤ndelsen var att en av dessa multicellulÃ¤ra organismer â€“ en fisk eller mask â€“ av det manliga kÃ¶net muterade till att vara agressiv och fÃ¶rinta andra manliga varelser. Han skulle ha fÃ¥tt hÃ¶gre tillgÃ¥ng till kvinnliga organismer jÃ¤mfÃ¶rt med hans icke-agressiva likar. Detta kan ocksÃ¥ kallas â€maktâ€ eftersom agressiva hanar hijackar andra hanars tillgÃ¥ng till kvinnor genom att dÃ¶da hanarna. Detta orsakar dinosaurierna eftersom stÃ¶rre muskelmassa och skarpare vapen Ã¤r bÃ¤ttre pÃ¥ att dÃ¶da rivalerna. Bland dinosaurierna fanns moder-avkomma-bandet, ditplacerad av evolutionen eftersom det var en fÃ¶rdel fÃ¶r mÃ¶drar att se sina barn Ã¶verleva till vuxenskap. Detta band muterade till att involvera flock-medlemmar eftersom en grupp sammarbetandes bÃ¤ttre kan vinna Ã¶ver individualister i brÃ¥k om vad som helst. NÃ¤sta stora steg var att nÃ¥gon kartlade flocken, i sin hjÃ¤rna, som en hierarki (upp-ned-axeln) med en lÃ¤ngtan efter att stÃ¥ hÃ¶gst upp i hierarkin. Denna kapitalistiska tÃ¤vlan mot toppen gjorde att hjÃ¤rnan vÃ¤xte sig stÃ¶rre â€“ stÃ¶rre minnesbank, mer detaljrika fÃ¶rutsÃ¤gelser och snabbare planering Ã¤r alla fÃ¶rdelar som kommer frÃ¥n att ha ett stÃ¶rre kortex.
Du har en komposit-sÃ¤ker sanning bestÃ¥endes av tvÃ¥ sÃ¤kra sanningar: du kan med sÃ¤kerhet sÃ¤ga att du tÃ¤nker (fÃ¶r att om du skulle bli lurad: att bli lurad Ã¤r en tankeprocess) och att du existerar (eftersom att bli lurad krÃ¤ver den som blir lurad). Jag tÃ¤nker och jag finns Ã¤r ett pÃ¥stÃ¥ende men tvÃ¥ sanningar. Du kan med sÃ¤kerhet pÃ¥stÃ¥ dig ha â€distinktionâ€ eftersom du har att gÃ¶ra med multipla separata entiteter (sÃ¥som â€jagâ€ och â€tankarâ€). Man kan sÃ¤ga, nÃ¤r man ser den sÃ¤kra sanningens â€jag tÃ¤nkerâ€ och â€jag existerarâ€, att avstÃ¥endet/mellanrummet mellan de tvÃ¥ idÃ©erna (tÃ¤nkare och tanke) Ã¤r distinktion. AvstÃ¥endet/mellanrummet som separarar tÃ¤nkare frÃ¥n tanke Ã¤r nÃ¶dvÃ¤ndigt fÃ¶r â€disktinktionâ€ att hÃ¤rledas som sÃ¤ker sanning fÃ¶ljandes ur nÃ¤sta logiska steg, med ursprunget av den originella primÃ¤ra sÃ¤kra sanningen.
Ã„r alla distinkta entiteter del av en singulÃ¤r verklighet om â€verklighetenâ€ Ã¤r definierad som â€det som allt Ã¤r del avâ€? Med andra ord: om vi ritar distinktion pÃ¥ vÃ¤nster sida av ett papper och anti-distinktion (distinktionÂ´s motsats: en ensam verklighet â€“ det som allt Ã¤r del av. Zoomandes ut maximalt) pÃ¥ hÃ¶ger sida av pappret, kan dÃ¥ distinktion representera hÃ¶ger sida av pappret dvs anti-distinktion? Hur skulle nÃ¥gon distinkt entitet kunna vara/representera motsatsen till vad representation/distinktion Ã¤r? Vilken representation som helst av anti-distinktion/verkligheten mÃ¥ste ha minst tre entiteter: tÃ¤nkare, mellanrummet mellan tÃ¤nkare och tanke, och tanke.
Separation/distinktion Ã¤r antaget i representation, vilket innebÃ¤r att anti-distinktion Ã¤r orepreserbart.
Hur vagt har universum/Gud definerat vad en representation Ã¤r dvs nÃ¤r en representation sker? VÃ¥ra hjÃ¤rnor anvÃ¤nder neuroner fÃ¶r att representera, men vad sÃ¤gs om â€“ istÃ¤llet fÃ¶r neuroner (oavsett om hjÃ¤rnor Ã¤r inblandade eller inte) â€“ universum lÃ¥ter vilket slumpmÃ¤ssigt valt objekt som helst lÃ¥ta sig sÃ¤gas, sÃ¥som neuroner sÃ¤gs, representera verkligheten? Universum har definierat â€representationâ€ oÃ¤ndligt vagt dvs uteslutandes hjÃ¤rnor sÃ¥ kan vilket slumpmÃ¤ssigt objekt som helst spotant bli/vara symbolen fÃ¶r all verklighet â€“ fÃ¶r att universum har definierat â€representeraâ€ oÃ¤ndligt vagt. Trots den oÃ¤ndligt vaga definitionen av vad som representerar vad, sÃ¥ gÃ¶r distinktions-anti-distinktions-oppositionen (linjen som separerar vÃ¤nster sida av pappret frÃ¥n hÃ¶ger sida; motsÃ¤ttningen mellan distinktion och anti-distinktion) att verkligheten Ã¤r orepresenterbar. Om verkligheten Ã¤r anti-distinktion dÃ¥ finns ingen distinktion (representation Ã¤r oundvikligen distinktion), trots universums oÃ¤ndligt vaga definition av â€representeraâ€, fÃ¥nga verkligheten. I representationer kan vi rÃ¤kna minst tre saker och det vi fÃ¶rsÃ¶ker representera Ã¤r en sak utan nÃ¥gonting utanfÃ¶r den. Faktumet att representationer innehÃ¥ller distinktion gÃ¶r att att fÃ¥nga verkligheten (allt som ett) omÃ¶jligt.
Vi kan ha oÃ¤ndligt mÃ¥nga eller oÃ¤ndligt innehÃ¥llsfulla/stora representationer/hypoteser â€“ sÃ¥som ett oÃ¤ndligt storleks-tids-diagram â€“ och genom att abstrakt peka till verkligheten, sÃ¥ gÃ¶r universums regel att ingenting representerar verkligheten trots universums oÃ¤ndligt vaga definition av â€representeraâ€ av oÃ¤ndligt mycket, gÃ¶r verkligheten orepresenterbar. Detta kan bara betyda en sak: verkligheten â€“ som vi kÃ¤nner som storlekar och tider (ett storleks-tids-diagram) â€“ Ã¤r oÃ¤ndligt. Det finns oÃ¤ndligt stort och oÃ¤ndligt litet med oÃ¤ndligt mycket dÃ¥tid och oÃ¤ndligt mycket framtid. Detta rektangulÃ¤ra storleks-tids-diagram dvs vÃ¥r vardagsvÃ¤rld av storlek-tid har oÃ¤ndligheter Ã¶verallt.
Energimassa i rumtid: ett i noll, existens i icke-existens, nÃ¥gonting i ingenting â€“ sÃ¥som definierats av E=mc
2
dÃ¤r c
2
stÃ¥r fÃ¶r ljusets hastighet (rum Ã¶ver tid dvs rumtid/noll/icke-existens) och E=m refererar till energimassa (existens, nÃ¥gonting, allt).
Distinktions-anti-distinktions-opposition: vi lever i en singulÃ¤r verklighet men vi ser multipla objekt.
En oÃ¤ndlig storleksskala.
De Ã¥vanstÃ¥ende tre idÃ©erna Ã¤r en existentiell teori (en teori som fÃ¶rklarar existensen av en reproduktiv form dvs evolutions bÃ¶rjan dvs vÃ¥r existens). Det Ã¤r modernt att anvÃ¤nda sig av tre likvÃ¤rdiga idÃ©er fÃ¶r att fÃ¶rklara ens existens â€“ alla tidigare existentiella teorier har antingen anvÃ¤nt en enda idÃ© (monoteism) eller en saga/myt (mÃ¥nga vardagliga (ej vetenskapliga/abstrakta) idÃ©er) fÃ¶r att fÃ¶rklara existens.
Den fÃ¶rutsÃ¤gande kvalitÃ©n som gÃ¶r denna existentiella teori till en vetenskaplig teori Ã¤r att den, baserat pÃ¥ en oÃ¤ndlig storleksskala av energimassarumtid och distinktions-anti-distinktions-opposition, fÃ¶rutsÃ¤ger att det i en oÃ¤ndlig storleksskala borde finnas en storlek dÃ¤r reproduktion (DNA) sker. Den existentiella teorin fÃ¶rutsÃ¤ger det fÃ¶rsta DNA:t, och frÃ¥n det fÃ¥r vi evolutionÃ¤r teori.
En annan fÃ¶rutsÃ¤gande kvalitÃ© Ã¤r att teorin fÃ¶rutsÃ¤ger att big bang borde varit
tÃ¤t
. A-priori begynnelsen av universum Ã¤r logiskt sett tomhet eftersom tomhet inte behÃ¶ver nÃ¥gon tidigare/fÃ¶religgande logiskt rÃ¤ttfÃ¤rdigande eftersom det ej existerar. I tom rumtid Ã¤r naturlagarna sanna, sÃ¥som naturlagarna som hanterar energimassa (sÃ¥som E=mc
2
), och dÃ¤rfÃ¶r bÃ¶rjar big bang oÃ¤ndligt tÃ¤t â€“ fÃ¶r att E=mc
2
Ã¤r lika sann samtidigt i de minsta storlekarna. De minsta tomma rymderna hade E=mc
2
som sann inom sig direkt nÃ¤r det fanns ingenting, vilket fÃ¶rutsÃ¤ger en tÃ¤t big bang. En region, inom event horizons gjorda av energimassa rusandes ivÃ¤g i >c (pga mÃ¶rk energi accelererandes kosmisk expansion) Ã¤r per definition â€ingentingâ€ i vilket E=mc
2
Ã¤r sann i de minsta utrymmena, vilket Ã¥stadkommer en big bang utom rÃ¤ckhÃ¥ll fÃ¶r de nÃ¤rmaste ( v = >c) energimassa. Ingenting (utom rÃ¤ckhÃ¥ll fÃ¶r nÃ¤rmaste energimassa fÃ¶r att den Ã¤r pÃ¥ vÃ¤g bortÃ¥t i >c) orsakas i centrumpunkten som har event horizons som grÃ¤ns lÃ¤ngst bort, vilket leder till en big bang (eftersom naturlagarna uppbringar energimassa i det tomma centrumet).
Det Ã¤r en stor historisk hÃ¤ndelse att det Ã¤ntligen finns ett ateistiskt argument i form av en universitetskurs: det Ã¤r en existentiell teori plus evolution som inte behÃ¶ver en personifierad gud fÃ¶r att fungera, utan dess pelare (oÃ¤ndlig storleksskala av energimassarumtid och distinktions-anti-distinktions-opposition) kan inte ha en personifierad gud tillagd till dem som en fjÃ¤rde pelare utan att teorin lÃ¥ter lÃ¶jlig. Det Ã¤r inte bara sÃ¥ att teorin inte behÃ¶ver en personifierad gud, utan att lÃ¤gga till en gud fÃ¶rstÃ¶r teorins minimalistiska rationellt kompletta skÃ¶nhet. Gudar fÃ¶rfular teorin. Teorins upptÃ¤ckt Ã¤r en stor historisk hÃ¤ndelse eftersom aldrig fÃ¶rr har en hel kurs (bÃ¶rjandes med sÃ¤ker sanning, gÃ¥endes genom den existentiella teorin och slutandes i evolution) lagts fram i ateismens intellektuella debatt, som ett argument mot en personifierad gud.
Anatomin i hjÃ¤rnan frÃ¥n att hÃ¶ra sÃ¤ker sanning (jag tÃ¤nker & jag finns) â€“ bÃ¶rjan av denna kurs â€“ skapar samma neuronala pathways / associationer mellan idÃ©er i varje person som hÃ¶r vet sÃ¤ker sanning. Det logiska steget till â€distinktionâ€ Ã¤r att notera, som meta-analys av den primÃ¤ra sÃ¤kra sanningen â€“ att man har mÃ¥nga idÃ©er (jag tÃ¤nker OCH jag finns) och att man kan ta den logiska vÃ¤gen till nÃ¤sta steg i kursen (distinktion finns). Att sedan motsÃ¤tta anti-distinktion med distinktion skapar den ofÃ¶rnimmbara â€“ â€mot resonâ€ (eftersom logik Ã¤r, i simpla mÃ¤nniskor, enbart visuell) â€“ slutsatsen att vi/distinktion inte kan se verkligheten/anti-distinktion. Distinktions-anti-distinktions-oppositionen Ã¤r svÃ¥rbegriplig fÃ¶r att den â€“ sÃ¥som formell logik eller matematik â€“ enbart anvÃ¤nder ord istÃ¤llet fÃ¶r bilder (den lingvistiska hjÃ¤rnhalvan istÃ¤llet fÃ¶r den visuella). Vi evolverade till att sÃ¤ga â€om jag kan se det sÃ¥ tror jag pÃ¥ detâ€ och det Ã¤r en god tumregel eftersom praktiska sekvenser hÃ¤ndelser kan verifieras som sanna eller osanna genom att visualisera dem. Men i denna filosofi: nej â€“ det mÃ¥ste vara lingvistiskt att vi fÃ¶rnekar oss sjÃ¤lva konceptet â€all verklighetâ€, vilket leder till slutsatsen att det finns mer till verkligheten Ã¤n nÃ¥gonting â€“ oavsett hur vagt universum definerat â€att representeraâ€ â€“ representerar. Detta tillÃ¤gger oÃ¤ndligt mÃ¥nga storlekar till vÃ¥r abstrakta stoorleksskala / storleks-tids-diagrammet; det gÃ¶r en rektangel (med storlek pÃ¥ y-axeln och tid pÃ¥ x-axeln) med oÃ¤ndlighetstecken i varje hÃ¶rn, som i sin tur blir en pelare i vÃ¥r personlig-gud-fÃ¶rnekande existentiella teori.
Att komma frÃ¥n sÃ¤ker sanningen genom enbart logiska steg (meta-analyser och motsÃ¤ttningsskapande av motsatser) till en existentiell teori som fÃ¶rutsÃ¤er evolutionen Ã¤r en stor historisk hÃ¤ndelse i ateismens historia.
I ett historiskt sammanhang Ã¤r anatomin (neurala anslutningar mellan idÃ©er och sekvenser logik) som skapas av denna kurs som ett paradigm-shifte in i en ny era av civilisation â€“ en era liknande den som finns pÃ¥ oÃ¤ndligt mÃ¥nga planeter vars vetenskap kommit lÃ¤ngre Ã¤n vÃ¥ra 4.5 miljarder Ã¥rs mittenpunkt i en vanlig vattenbÃ¤rande planets historia.
Evolution, genom att bÃ¶rja frÃ¥n â€en massa som samlar kringliggande massa till en liknande formâ€ kliver fram frÃ¥n den existentiella teorins oÃ¤ndliga storleksskala av energimassarumtid. Om vi antar att DNA Ã¤r replikationsmolekylen sÃ¥ kan vi ta steget till â€“ klivandes Ã¶ver hur cellvÃ¤ggar evolverade osv â€“ till att virus hijackar andras reproduktiva system. Detta â€“ i den universella inter-planetÃ¤ra rymdvarelsekulturen â€“ formuleras som, i bÃ¶cker av logik, som att de tre fÃ¶rsta reglerna uppkommer (liv/dÃ¶d, antalet avkomma har betydelse och â€det sker mutationer i varje generationsskifteâ€) och sedan att en fjÃ¤rde regel uppkommer (makt, med virus). Denna historia â€“ som i vÃ¥r kurs bÃ¶rjar frÃ¥n den fÃ¶rsta reproduktiva formen och slutar i att finslipa anatomin bakom makt i mÃ¤n â€“ Ã¤r visualiseringsbar som en grottmanna-historias narrativ likt dem vi evolverade till att se/hÃ¶ra. Vi kan proof-checka/validera historian genom att se den visuellt. Evolutions visuella natur Ã¤r i stark kontrast till den rent linguistiska/abstraka natur som den existentiella teorin har.
PÃ¥ tal om â€abstraktaâ€ beskrivningar dvs beskrivningar som gÃ¶r det vÃ¤ldigt klart fÃ¶r oss att vÃ¥r fÃ¶rstÃ¥else av universum bara Ã¤r en karta (en referens) och inte verkligheten i sig (tÃ¤nk pÃ¥ PlatoÂ´s och KantÂ´s grottmetafor och â€saken Ã¤r inte saken sjÃ¤lvâ€-filosofierâ€)â€¦ Storleksskalan av energimassarumtid, i storleken av kvantfysik har oss beskrivandes fotoner etc anvÃ¤ndandes bÃ¥de vÃ¥g-beskrivningar med fokus pÃ¥ lÃ¤ngder i rymd (dessa Ã¤r â€rumtids-beskrivningarâ€) OCH â€“ i vÃ¥r-partikel-dualitet â€“ energimassabeskrivningen dvs att energin i en foton Ã¤r dess fÃ¤rg. FÃ¤rg (sÃ¥som den uppfattas genom Ã¶gonen), vÃ¥g/rumtids-beskrivningen och partikel-energi/energimassa-beskrivningen Ã¤r alla legitimea beskrivningar av kvantfysiken.

De flesta andra planeter dvs majoriteten av rymdvarelser Ã¤r m.a.o. ideologiska anhÃ¤ngare av teorin. Sprid denna teori fÃ¶r att fÃ¥ bekrÃ¤ftelse av majoriteten trots att den bor ljusÃ¥r bort. Just nu lever 99.9% av jordens befolkning i eran av religioner â€“ sprid denna teori fÃ¶r att fÃ¥ slut pÃ¥ religiÃ¶sa krig samt terrorism sÃ¥som 9/11. VÃ¤rldsbilden (bilden/diagrammet som fÃ¶rklarar vÃ¤rlden) Ã¤r densamma i den kosmiska majoriteten.
Jag har jobbat i 10 Ã¥r fÃ¶r att Ã¥stadkomma teorin och som ensam om att kÃ¤nna till den Ã¤r det mitt ansvar att den sprids. Den framtida civilizationen i vilken alla har samma vÃ¤rldsbild hÃ¤nger dÃ¤rfÃ¶r pÃ¥ mig. Jag kÃ¤nner en unik mÃ¶jlighet att pÃ¥verka jordens framtid.

Can we
timetravel? We can proceed from era to era, just like dinosaurs preceded man and not vice versa â€“ its a universal sequence on any planet.
Heaven/karma instinctual but collides with main picture.
Water, primordial soup, proteins, dns strand. Single cell reproducing multiplying. Then 1 of these cells thought â€œill inject my own dna into some other cellâ€, hijack its reproductive system. Very beneficial. So first there were 3 rules: life n death, number of offspring matters and mutation in each generationshift, then with viruses came the 4th rule â€œpowerâ€ â€“ hijacking othersâ€™ reproductive system. Then theres an arms race between viruses and â€¦ â€œOur kind ofâ€ organism, so to mutate our immune system faster two genders arose. Then fights between males led to the dinosaurs. Then brains bonded into groups to fight individualists. Then capitalist power struggles within the group made the brain grow larger, weâ€™re good at planning and remembering things. Then we get to kingdoms. From the water puddle to the 21 st century. Those who proceed to the next era will live in a world where holy book-group bonds are weak and a universal courses group bond is the strongest, thus national wars or civilizational wars where identity is based on other than this science will be impossible. The planet has two future ways to go 60 years from now and one is better but needs some investment of time until everybody knows this course.
Theres a universal course/book thats on every advanced enough planet throughout the universe and at the regeneration of every universe. If you consider the entire corpus of human knowledge, youd find 3 rational starting points: certain truth, nothingness and that reality is one. Just like dinosaurs predate humans the first chapter with the 3 starting points predate the connecting of â€œi think n i exist, distinctionâ€ and â€œreality is one, antidistinction. Which leads to that there is more to reality than can be contemplated meaning that its infinite. Thats chaper 2: like multiplication and division are much higher levels of mathematics than adding and subtracting, chaper 2 is higher than the starting points in chapter 1.
â€”â€”â€”
If you want to be altruistic/selfless you can think about the millions of lives lost or living as refugees due to religious wars and group-loyalties based on ideology/religion. What if group-loyalty could be, for everyone, based on a single universal ideology? Then friendship ties, shared histories, well-mixing personalities and the like would form groups that donÂ´t have a religious mission/an ideological drive. When all ideologies are erased â€“ and religions too â€“ then simple biological mechanisms like common goals, shared interests and family ties bind us together â€“ and those kind of conglomerations are more likely to disintegrate than if there is a holy book or any ideological book as the binding principle between people. If ISIS would be educated then it would disintegrate and many civil wars break out among different families in Iraq/Syria â€“ but there would not be this major cleft between western&modern and holy&dogmatic.
If you want to be selfish like Ayn Rand: the upcoming world order / economy will be a meritocracy based on who advances or knows the most science. The ancient Chinese had a government where even the lowest peasant, if he passed a test in ConfusciousÂ´ teachings, could elevate himself higher in the society. Hierarchy is based on what is objectively to be admired; hierarchy is based on what infinitely many extraterrestrials in consensus have agreed upon be the criteria for how a humanÂ´s thoughts should be wired; hierarchy is based on the universeÂ´s disposition to reward those with the most accurate world-view or whom advance the pre-existing world-view and spread it to others â€“ the universe wants us choose to elevate in the hierarchy those whom appriciate the universe most fully, wholistically and most accurately. The old power-system based on money is upheld by banks and is based on present day humansÂ´ ties to the past. There will be an overlap between the old bank-based system for establishing VIP-status and the new economy which is a meritocracy based on science. If we want to be like planets ahead of us in the evolution of history, we ought to adapt the meritocracy-economy. After a few generations inherited money seems less legitimate than knowing or advancing science and by doing so wiring oneÂ´s cortex (flexible thinking part of the brain) as universally as possible (as much like the consensus among extraterrestrials is as possible).
There are three universal starting points for the universal course which will wire your brain universally. What I mean by â€œuniversalâ€ is that:
A) it is based on science meaning that it is retrievable from anywhere at any time; it is available universally unlike some time-specific language-specific location-specific holy-book-revalation.
B) universal means that it is how aliens/extraterrestrials sooner or later wire their brains. Sure: they can choose to live in a multi-worldviewical world but sooner or later the truth will conquer meaning that all various ideas among every tribe or nation will congregate (like a lens focuses many beams of light into one focal point) into a single set of ideas and prioritarizations â€“ a single world-view will emerge from the many. It is the identical world-view that all civilizing planets will congregate to/toward because science is universal. This congregating is as much of a universal step in evolution as that a planet with water will eventually have bacteria. Eventually everyone will know the course and the idea of this book. â€œWhat do you believe?â€ will no longer be a question because everyone has wired their cortexÂ´s ideas based on universal ideas/science.
â€”â€”â€“
Am I a muslim?
I have my size-time-diagram into which everything fits and this diagram being infinite gives an existential theory because:
â€“ sizes justify (are the cause of) one another, so thereÂ´s infinite justification.
â€“ time is infinite and our universe is observed to become nothingness in the future, and nothingness would be absurd if not for the fact that in the smallest spaces energymass is summoned because E=mc2 is a stable, constant law of nature.
â€“ there can only be separate distinct entities if distinction is counter-balanced and happens in non-distinction (a singular Reality). This point is much like the previous point of that only in nothingness can somethingness be summoned.
God, then, if we are to look for a meaning for the word, cannot be:
â€“ a specific object, size nor time within something infinitely larger
â€“ cannot, by definition, be apart from and â€œbeyondâ€ [that of which all is part] (Reality). Reality being an infinite size- and time-range of energymasspacetime is enough of an existential theory to explain us being here, the Big Bang, and the rest of the questions. God would, if claimed to be â€œbeyondâ€ the existential theory, be an unnecessary unproven assumption but more to the point: God would be â€œunrealâ€ if Reality is defined as we define it here. Such â€œbeyond Realityâ€-gods are unreal. WhatÂ´s more is that the phrase â€œAllah akbarâ€ (God is the biggest/greatest) wouldnÂ´t be true if Reality/[that of which all is part] is God plus Reality â€“ if [that of which all is part] has two major components, God and an energymasspacetime sizerange etc (the existential theory), then the sum of those two components is greater than God.
God, thus, obviously means Reallity by the definition of God being the greatest. God is then infinite. It makes sense to see people in awe over how much they can study, when they know thereÂ´s infinitely many fields of science which we do not have access to but which are logical and necessities for Reality to hold together. There being nothing absurd in an infinite size-range that resembles our known size-range (from quantum physics to the visible universe) is awesome and the highest you could possibly worship. This again proves that God is just a synonym for Reality/the existential theory.
Having studied all fields of science i.e. all sizes is the known sizerange, seeing how they all make up (justify) eachother (that itÂ´s just zooming in and zooming out), the wisdom that the sizerange is infinite (that there are infinitely many sizes making up one another) from the distinction (I think & I am logical path) and anti-distinction (that Reality is one) -thing, is the reason why we exist and God is not some size (sizes are not minds, except through evolution). Having studied all known sizes and knowing that the sizerange is infinite: it is an explanation to why weÂ´re here (akin to the Adam and Eve story or â€œGod created earth in 6 daysâ€ story) but it is not a revalation-giving thing â€“ the Quran wasnÂ´t written by God because God is not the kind of thing that writes/dictates stories. God being an infinite sizerange as thus our Creator is true, but the true way to get knowledge, rituals/pictoral representations and even guidance is through my work, not the work of the holy book-writers. The holy book writers might have said something true about God (just like I do in my work) â€“ but that is true of science textbooks moreso â€“ and they all said false things such as that God talks/gives revalations/authors holy books.
I can see the bronze-age marketing-teamÂ´s standpoint: people are more prone to follow dictates if theyÂ´re said to come from something/someone â€œhigher than humanâ€ i.e. a God or a ghost/spirit. Being invisible in as nonsense-a-way as some rituals are, is great for marketing. Everyone knows how humans thing â€“ theyÂ´re themselves human; we are only partly rational (a computer is rational) in what we think â€“ all our animal lusts bias or interrupt the thoughts that are as logical as they get, but theyÂ´re always going to be based against an evolutionary background just like the pitfall that my abstract diagram-including infinity-mentioning world-view is more like algebra than â€œwhat a world-view (context in which we are) should be thinking about that we lived for millions of years on the savannah, only needing to know (in oneÂ´s world-view) where the water-source is or whom stands under whom in the social hierarchy. WeÂ´ve mapped geographies, the use-based properties of objects/tools and personalities (and still do) for a gazillion years â€“ only with the advent of science SOME of us achieved higher i.e. used their evolved meager toolkit with all its biases to scetch out something like the theory of evolution in the 1800s. Looking at the evolution of [what we use our memory for]/how we map our surroundings/our world-view, before we mapped social relationships we mapped geographies. Before we mapped the functions of inventions (tools) our map only contained caveman tools (sharp stones and spears). The next step is to map oneÂ´s context as an infinite size-time-diagram (where size and time are really the same, but abstract thinking allows us to separate them into two distinct axises) or energymasspacetime (with itsÂ´ many laws of nature found in every school textbook in the world) and the distinction-antidistinction-
thing which feels so awkward/abstract that one wonders why one needs it as pillar 3 of the existential theory: the answer is: it wasnÂ´t invented (the words â€œI see a distinct objectâ€ or â€œwhy is there distinction?â€ werenÂ´t said in the same breath as â€œReality is oneâ€ or â€œenergymass and spacetime uniteâ€) until I did it in the 21st century). It might seem trivial to mention that separate entities exist in a singular Reality â€“ itÂ´s so obvious (thatÂ´s why no-one cared to make a big fuzz out of inventing it) but it makes the existential theory have three pillars (all of which can seem obvious) and not 4 â€“ thereÂ´s nothing more to add to the existential theory once youÂ´ve added the obvious â€œseparation in antidistinctionâ€-statement. I want to know how aliens (the infinitely many of them, steered by science toward an incommon path) think because its synonymous to finding a TRUE â€œkey to historyâ€ (Marx thought the key was equality, Hitler thought the key was racial superiority and a brutally competative relationship between races, Capitalism thinks itÂ´s freedom (less government), some might think they â€œkey to historyâ€ is to fund technological development). â€œHow aliens thinkâ€ is a shorthand way of saying â€œthe key to historyâ€ or â€œwhat will happen next/eventually and in hindsight seen as akin to the era of ancient grecoroman culture, the Industrial Revolution or the Digital revolution)â€. ItÂ´s what weÂ´re steered towards; itÂ´s the closest thing we get to divine guidance. ItÂ´s simply universal (drawn on science and practiced by infinitely many aliens) guidance/suggestions/
recommendations that we, as a species, can choose to promogate and thus â€œfollowâ€ or if weÂ´ll stick to multiculturalismÂ´s many -ismÂ´s like political quran-based islamism or christian-based â€œthe holy book gave me thisâ€-morality and codes of conduct. Some -ismÂ´s are dangerous (like quran-based politics and law) while some -ismÂ´s like christianity give too much credit to the -ism for simple human decency (in an age of extreme wealth globally). When my tummy is full IÂ´m a decent person â€“ I try to make money but IÂ´m not desparate after extreme wealth because I know that my caveman-brainÂ´s â€œneedâ€ for power (through status-symbols and freedom of space my environment to maximize the effectiveness of my hobby (writing)) wonÂ´t get satisfied no matter what external extravaganzas trigger my eyeballs, nor can people (socializing) make me much more satisfied than I am right now because all that is interesting and that there is to people is their brain â€“ and after a few weeks together thereÂ´ll be nothing I know nor any mental tool that I use that wonÂ´t, despite copyright, be in the hands of my friend: we wonÂ´t talk science (me teaching him/her) after all the science has been taught. I donÂ´t care to teach trivia so when I say â€œI teach SCIENCEâ€ I mean a finite thing: the existential theory plus something from each level of the known sizerange. Getting a P.hD from specializing on finding the structure of a rare protein only found in the feet of Amazonian forrest-mice is to put your eyes too close to the diagram; P.hDs for specializing/having a very narrow topic for oneÂ´s mind to engage in are for people who donÂ´t see the forest for the trees and care to rather look at one leaf of one tree instead of thinking about and seeing the forest as a whole. IÂ´m a forest person â€“ a leaf 10 cm from my eyes just bugs me. ThatÂ´s why there is a finite repertoire to what I call â€œscienceâ€ â€“ it takes a few days for me (my accomplishment/my work) to be fully understood and if repeated repetative. One only needs to know why/where one exists (the existential theory) once â€“ one canÂ´t forget it because we are made to remember the very context in which we live (here an evolutionary bias helps us: when someone explains â€œwhat the world isâ€ we remember it because â€œwhat the world wasâ€ in caveman days was the most useful thing the brain could do â€“ in fact we evolved such large brains because bigger brains remember better (can moreso map social relationships, successfull or unsuccesfull learning-experiences). We want to climb upwards in the hierarchy, find a mate, etc but all these wants and needs would be useless (theyÂ´d having nothing to work on) if it werenÂ´t for the map (of social relationships etc) that our brain is capable of remembering. We are inclined to remember existential theories because such knowledge about our place in the context was as useful as mapping whom is married to whom. This bias, by the way, is something holy book writers used to get people interested in their book. â€œGod created earth in 6 days (not 5)â€ is memorable because of our bias toward wanting to know about â€œcreation of the worldâ€ â€“ so the number â€œ6 daysâ€ is remembered too because it adds to the map that we then work on to seek power and other evolutionary benefits. ItÂ´s hard to make plans that have one reach evolutionary benefits if one does not know oneÂ´s environment/the external world. â€œ6 days for creating this place/worldâ€ adds to oneÂ´s map of the environment/place/external world. We have a bias for remembering it. Too bad the bronze-age holy books used this marketing trick (â€œhey, letÂ´s say something about their world (like the creation of it) because that would be something they remember!â€) to give pseudo- existential theories. The holy books made sales because not only do people want information about their context, people also want God to talk and interfere with day-to-day personal activites. Once you have a pseudo-explanation for how/why the world was created, youÂ´re free to add to that pseudo-explanation that â€œthe creator talksâ€. ItÂ´s impossible to add such a talking thing to my existential theory â€“ not only is it unnecessary (my theory works stand-alone) but it also contradicts basically every concept of my existential theory. The very definitions of energymasspacetime (meaning that God had nothingness as the canvas to paint on â€“ a nothingness that needs energymass and summons it because of the laws of nature inherent in that nothingness â€“ and chose to paint a beginning with as-dense-as-can-be (just like E=mc2 wouldÂ´ve created it because E=mc2 is true in the smallest spaces). Where was God when this happened? CouldnÂ´t have been energymass because energymass is only summoned once the universe becomes pure nothingness. If God is not energymass and energymass is existence â€“ then God doesnÂ´t exist / God is nothing. What doesnÂ´t exist or is nothing doesnÂ´t give revalations to men, doesnÂ´t care whom you sleep with, etc. Is God or GodÂ´s heaven a location in our size of infinite spacetime? In that case God is simply a far-away alien (which warrants questions about its evolution) but again â€“ it doesnÂ´t talk to us because of the distance and we wouldnÂ´t be too impressed even if an evolved God did talk to us (we are quite like it â€“ our science is the same, our world-view is the same). God is not a location in a size but is God a size? The sizerange is infinite (as proven by distinction not being able to see antidistinction) and thatÂ´d mean that thereÂ´s a creator to God (and that thing too has a creator, ad infinitum) IN THE SAME WAY as humans built cities or atoms make molecules. Again, if God is a size it warrantÂ´s the question: is God every location of that size or is God, like humans, in a location of that size? Whatever be the case, God still couldnÂ´t communicate with us. Since God fits neither in the context of energymasspacetime nor the context of the sizerange, a God-theory absolutely contradicts the true theory. What is said about God â€“ that God is the greatest â€“ makes only one â€œlocationâ€/notion in the existential theory correspond to a non-talking uncaring God: the theory itself (and more precisely Reality/[that of which all is part]) is the greatest. It certainly doesnÂ´t hear/talk nor give revalations because it comes as an infinite sizerange of energymasspacetime. When you tell this science, you can get to the point where you define Reality as â€œthat of which all is partâ€ and the greatest â€“ you can even get to antidistinction/the unrepresentability of Reality (fully, because we do represent some things) and people might still hope that a talking God can exist. But as soon as you mention the less abstract (the more abstract was that [that of which all is part cannot be observed]), the God-theory either surrenders or is in conflict with a/the existential theory which certainly is true (anyone can verify how the components of the theory fit together, make sense and explain everything). God as a synonym for Reality is boring â€“ why do we even have two words if we mean the same (scientific sizerange) thing.
If you assume that God is a synonym for Reality (which comes as an infinite sizescale, which in turn predicts a DNA-strand somewhere and voila: everything is explained), then I believe in your God. It doesnÂ´t appriciate my appriciation of it though, nor do rituals, following rules (made by men) etc please it. If I am to â€œshow my appriciation to itâ€ I do it by writing as I do right now â€“ thatÂ´s my worship of it: but IÂ´m under no illusion that this writing would please God by being logical (eventhough Reality itself is logical too â€“ so we have something incommon) â€“ me writing can be called worship but the only appriciating recipients of my writing are me and readers of my text. Whatever I write about Reality/God doesnÂ´t please God (because God is not a thing that listens, likes worship by others and other human needs) â€“ whatever worshippers do, I hope they do it for themselves and for other humans because no-one else is able to care or comprehend the worship. I would do the muslim prayer if I felt that that kind of discipline would benefit me (and a few times I did get a good feeling from going to the mosque and being among worshippers). ItÂ´s so easy to adapt to the customs of oneÂ´s peers (and especially oneÂ´s superiors, if one believes that there are those) that my attitude toward worship/ritual is â€œwhen in Rome, do like the romans (if you or others gain something out of it)â€. The world is complex â€“ I could have the same attitude toward the beliefs of islam: that IÂ´ll just say that something is through eventhough it obviously isnÂ´t because it contradicts, say, a talking holy book-writing God. Could I make myself believe that something talkative is God? The belief disintegrates and I get the foul feeling of that IÂ´ve used my valuable memory to note down a lie everytime I would think just one step/association further from the belief itself. I can believe (in anything) but analyzing it even the smallest amount will make me disbelieve it. But when youÂ´re in the mood of not analyzing â€“ like when one is having a panic attack on oneÂ´s death-bed â€“ IÂ´ll be (extremely) simplistic and do what some people seem to always do: â€œbelieve (in something that breaks down when analyzed)â€. What confuses me is that some people believe all the time â€“ they seem perfectly sane but they believe in a talking, scripture-giving God (that doesnÂ´t fit anywhere in the existential theory). Do they need comfort (from untruth) all the time? It seems like theyÂ´re trying to argue their position, though. A perplexing phenomenon at first glance but when you consider that theyÂ´re uneducated about my existential theory, any theory will do (even a talking God-theory). I am not hateful of it when I see it in other people â€“ I see it as humorous/ridicilous â€“ but when it binds people together (to form what in essence is an army) and thereÂ´s many of them (10 000 religions/â€armiesâ€) the worldÂ´s got a problem. Binding people together through their shared scripture and their belief that something impossible is true is bad because groups tend to be more violent than individualists â€“ especially if their holy text 1) seems to bind billions of people to their army (morale-strength amplification in a group is the root of violence), and 2) preaches violence/disrespect (many holy books are xenophobic and eager to create an â€œus vs. themâ€-social dynamic). If the holy book is taken seriously (if it canÂ´t be thrown in the trash) then we have bronze-age xenophobia (based on who likes the book and who doesnÂ´t) creeping into the modern day, and we also have artificial bonding/loyalty â€“ we basically get groups who are hostile (or more disrespectful) toward anyone who doesnÂ´t see the point (â€œthereÂ´s a talking Godâ€) theyÂ´re promoting. ItÂ´s such an easily fixable problem: if you read my work you simply cannot believe in a talking God â€“ my professional role is that you can give me ANY individual and I can â€œconvertâ€ him/her into not believing in a talking God. Whether this person will follow his or her groupÂ´s rituals or codes of conduct, though, is up to them â€“ itÂ´s sheer peer pressure.
The â€œus vs. themâ€ â€œwe are a big groupâ€ (and especially) â€œwe should convert the whole world so that they use their precious memory for knowing nonsense like we doâ€ are such great reasons for violence â€“ and of course itÂ´s fixable because what these people lack is education: only where there is no theory, can a pseudo-theory take root. Only where there is no argument/debate/science can â€œGod talksâ€ seem like legitimate truth. This means that much of the worldÂ´s violence is due to a lack of education (about the big questions i.e. what I talk about). Sure: some religions can be interpreted to say â€œkill the infidelsâ€ or some other explicit declaration of war â€“ but itÂ´s hard for a religion to survive if it constantly preaces fighting (it must have more clever tactics than that â€“ but it does tend to seek world-dominion). IÂ´m not so worried that someone reads the Quran and thinks â€œIÂ´ll help the [unbelieves in the QuranÂ´s talking God] to get to hell faster, because the Quran says that thatÂ´s where they belongâ€. I am worried about that the Quran (or any holy book) is the glue that binds people together. Religion is the last glue before we enter an era where obviously arbitrary things like nationalism or language makes strangers feel more familiar with eachother. Nation and language arenÂ´t taken that seriously â€“ nor should religion be, but it is. This binding-effect that holy books have is what makes ISIS / the taliban etc so hard to defeat â€“ they think, not only that they have an all-seeing revalation-giving God on their side, but they also have the exact same copy of a book that a billion people have. They feel strong (with their, seemingly to them, superior numbers). Obviously ISIS underestimated the ability of the Quran to draw in arab nations into the fight over Iraq & Syria â€“ the modern world simply leaned on the fact that ISIS are not muslims because they interpret the bronze-age ramble wrong. But ISIS / the taliban is still a factor â€“ the quran binds too many people together in certain areas of the world â€“ violence is caused, due to the binding-effect, the â€œmoral superiorityâ€-effect, the â€œpower in numbers and billions of people read the Quranâ€-effect etc (all these effects are there even if you skip the parts about the talking God who word for word said the Quran) make men as prone to violence as anything can make them: theyÂ´re a group with an â€œus vs. themâ€ dogma & feeling and they feel like they have power in numbers. Add to that the frustration over having to finance an own home before one can ejaculate. Those circumstances can make the group take up arms and â€œsend the infidels where they belongâ€. Following the commandments frustrates, the whole notion of â€œletÂ´s all prioritize this text highest (our favorite book) so that weÂ´re bound togetherâ€ and that the text itself can be interpreted as violent all are a breeding-ground for trouble â€“ and when youÂ´re in the trouble that the text creates, you are not in the state of mind to do the internal debate necessary to disprove a talking God and thus make your whole way of life become something that you either do as meaningless fun or donÂ´t do because no-one cares. But just as some people want to become professional soccer players and some atheists do zen-meditation, humans (by personal preference) want hobbies, to take up a discipline, to do something that adds, say, pride to their life. I donÂ´t personally care about soccer and I donÂ´t feel pride from doing any ritual, but I can definitely see that others take the muslim prayers like an athlete takes their sport. ItÂ´s possible to find out the objective truth about whether these prayers â€œplease God or notâ€ (by, like IÂ´ve done in this text, disproving all kinds of false Gods and making the real God more mundane and not a talker). Rituals donÂ´t please Reality/â€the energymasspacetime sizerangeâ€ because it is not a thing that gets pleased â€“ itÂ´s like trying to please a rock. You do the prayers because you enjoy the pride/hobby for its own sake â€“ like someone doing sports likes his/her sport. Pleasing a rock/God to get to a â€œheavenâ€ (which too doesnÂ´t fit into the true existential theory) is stupid unless itÂ´s akin to a hobby/sport where you do it for doing itÂ´s sake. Same thing with the â€œheaven hates hamâ€-thing â€“ when you know enough science (enough = what IÂ´ve written so far in this text) youÂ´ll realize that the whole ham-prohibition is man-made (from the bronze age) and linked to some pre-scientific nonsense from-the-horseÂ´s-mouth-
statement (canÂ´t say rationale because itÂ´s dogma). If you (and secondarily your peers) are dedicated to nonsense (whether it be sports, stamp-collecting, memorizing capitals or not eating pork), then do it if it does something good like prove to yourself (and others) that you have a strong discipline (even though your effort is misdirected toward nonsense). I can invent a ritual and do it every day, and maybe IÂ´d feel pride over that I can keep to a schedule of nonsense, but I would never claim the theory that there is a talking God, and by extention I wouldnÂ´t say that that ficticious talker prohibited ham. The mundane action must be differentiated from the logical argument. Ham-prohibitions and talking Gods are artifacts that belong in the past â€“ modern white A4-paper is too beautiful for someone to write something as erroneous as â€œthere is a talking Godâ€ on it. But as IÂ´m writing this, people are dying because religion binds them together (and frustrates them, and boosts their war-morale in many ways). My work can cause a civil war within ISIS â€“ a civil rift so permiating that only family ties, friendships and common goals (to get money, not to spread islam) can keep people together in groups. Once my existential theory is known there will still be crime and instability in Iraq, Syria and Afghanistan, but the evil deeds will only be committed by groups of 2-3 people â€“ not 20 000 of them. The binding effect of the Quran can most clearly be seen in that internet-propaganda made Quran-readers from the USA and Europe go fight in Syria â€“ everyone wants a group and itÂ´s totally human to assume that knowing the same book will be enough for a bond to be as strong as one wants it to be.
Right now â€œmy workâ€ is 9 proper texts and a few videos. They all talk about the same thing (which can be formulated as: IÂ´ll say as much as I can about things IÂ´ve never heard anyone else say (and IÂ´ve seen the best professors in the world teaching truths)). To cause a rift in the taliban/ISIS and stop the war by making group-bonding (around a holy book) problematic/impossible, my whole â€œworkâ€ doesnÂ´t need to be dropped as propaganda books on top of ISIS and the taliban. ItÂ´s enough that the news headlines say that â€œa correct all-explaining existential theory has been found â€“ religions in crysisâ€ or that enough people know my theory so that a multitude of youtube videos are made where, in a sentence or two, the presenter goes off-topic and mentions why we exist / something from my theory. Having understood it once makes it impossible to forget â€“ having understood it once makes group-bonding over religion (which fuels ISIS/the taliban/etc) impossible. If the world could just take 20 minutes of itsÂ´ time to spend on explaining/teaching/arguing my work/theory, then the war on terror would be over â€“ otherwise it will persist as long as people have no actual, logical theory about their existence and thus believe in bronze-age marketing tricks.
â€”â€”-
The theory of evolution begins with the first reproducing shape. It was a shape that assembled surrounding mass into a similar shape. The existential theory predicts the existence of infinitely many such shapes. What inevitable becomes true when you have reproduction is that some die and some survive (life and death), that the number of offspring that shape make matters and that there is mutations over time. This is true about the shapeÂ´s offspring: some will die and some will survive, the number of offspring they make matters and the offspring can be different from the original shape. These three rules / laws of nature were inactive before the first reproduction occurred. The next main event was that one of these shapes found that if it injected its DNA into other shapesÂ´ reproductive mechanism, it exploited principle number two: that the number of offspring matters. It was the first virus: it hijacked othersÂ´ reproduction. The rule / law of nature that came into play with this event was that â€œpowerâ€ matters: hijacking othersÂ´ reproductive mechanism gives evolutionary benefits. Now weÂ´ve listed the four main rules that govern evolutionary theory: first came the three first, and then came the forth: power. The next main event â€“ to guard against viruses taking over all life / reproductive mechanisms â€“ was that an immune system evolved to protect against virusÂ´ hijack attempts. This required multicellularism. Just like immune systems prompt/require multicellularism, immune systems prompt/require multigenderedism: to win in the arms race against quickly mutating viruses two genders arose to amplify the mutations to the immune system. Mixing genes from two genders creates a more mutated immune system, which can keep ahead in the arms race against quickly-mutating viruses â€œtryingâ€ to mutate to bypass any immune system. The next main event is that one of these multicellular organisms â€“ a fish or worm â€“ of the male gender mutated to be agressive and defeat other males in battle. He wouldÂ´ve gotten access to many more females than his non-agressive counter-parts. This too can be called â€œpowerâ€ because the agressive male hijacks other maleÂ´s access to females by killing the males. This prompts the dinosaurs because larger muscle mass and shaper weaponry is better at killing off competitors. Amongst the dinosaurs there was the mother-offspring bond, placed there by evolution for the evolutionary benefits a mother gets from seeing an offspring survive to adulthood. This bond mutated to involve flock-members because a group working together out-competes any individualists when fighting over anything. The next main event was that someone mapped the flock, in his brain, as a hierarchy (up-down-axis) with the longing to dominate peers.

Dude, evolution has me try to maximize evolutionary benefits using my plans; im always thinking at full speed and pain drives that thinking. And i know for certain that all this pain is meaningless. Its a suicide recipe but what prevents me from suicide is the natural strength that stems from being the pinnacle of beasts who all have survived for generations.

New book 2017
Chapter 1:
What problem does this solve?
This solves a problem that becomes most visible 60 years from now when sea-levels rise, the economy goes into permanent decline and oil ends. ThatÂ´s when humans start to fight (and belong in world-view-based groups to do so). While the economy is still rising the clashes are few and far between â€“ Afghanistan, Syria, ISISÂ´ world-wide terror attacks (mainly muslim world-views clashing with tolerant world-views). When the economy starts declining thereÂ´ll naturally be more friction between groups, and groups are made up of world-views (people identify as in a group based on world-view).
Advancing the scientific world-view to the level where it explains our origin and thus invades religious intellectual turf, solves the problem of world-views colliding as war.
Chapter 2:
Certain truth â€“ I think & I am
You have a composite certain truth consisting of two certain truths: you can claim as certain that you think (because if you were being fooled: being fooled is thinking) and that you exist (because being fooled requires the one who is fooled to be there). I think and I exist is one statement but two truths. You can certainly claim to have â€œdistinctionâ€ because youÂ´re dealing with multiple separate distinct entities (such as â€œIâ€ and â€œthoughtâ€). One could put it, while seeing the certain truths â€œI thinkâ€ and â€œI existâ€, that the space between the two notions (thinker and thought) is the hallmark of distinction. The distance separating thinker from thought we can recognize as necessary for â€œdistinctionâ€ to be concluded as a certain truth arising, in a next logical step, from the original primary certain truth.
Everyone agrees they they themselves exist, because if one would get fooled in everyone one can be fooled in then one would exist there anyway and be fooled. So one knows that one exists. Then one also knows that one thinks because â€œto get fooledâ€ is a thought-process. Thus we have two things: I think and I exist. And the distinction between them: and on the flipside of the paper we have the opposite of that: anti-distinction, and this can also be called â€œthat of which all is partâ€/Reality. And since we are in the distinction-side of the paper when we see something; when we see something there is distinction between us and that thing. Thus we cannot represent or see that which is on the other side of the paper i.e. that of which all is part / Reality. Nothing can represent â€“ because it is distinct â€“ Reality. So whatever which is distinct cannotâ€¦ whatever that is observed or represented is distinct and therefore is notâ€¦ therefore does not represent Reality / â€œthat of which all is partâ€. So we have distinction and anti-distinction as opposing poles.
You have a certain truth which everyone in the whole world agrees upon. You think and you exist since if you were being fooled by an almighty demon youÂ´d still both think and exist. Then there are two things i.e. distinction. All is part of a single reality which is anti-distinction, there are no separate parts: reality is one. If we put distinction on the left side of the paper and anti-distinction on the right side then (we) distinction cannot see that of which all is part because â€œto seeâ€ is â€œto representâ€ and then one uses something to refer to reality. There is nothing outside reality which can refer to reality but instead reality is defined as â€œthat of which all is partâ€ and then there is nothing that can refer to all of reality. The opposition between the two sides of the paper (distinction & anti-distinction) makes reality as â€œthat of which all is partâ€-anti-distinction non-representable because representation always involves distinction. What we see, for example, is just parts of reality. The hypotheses can be infinitely much so there is infinitely much to reality. Sizes and times, that is. In the existential theory (â€œwhy we existâ€) there, thus, is an infinite size-range with time, energymass in spacetime (everything and nothing intertwined like in the E=mc2 equation â€“ energy equals mass times, well â€“ spacetime; multiplication is what unites energymass with spacetime). Then we have distinction and anti-distinction: separate things but all is part of a single reality. The existential theory with its three pillars, that is an infinite sizerange, energymasspacetime and distinction-anti-distinction-opposition, predicts that there should be a tiny piece of DNA which copies itself.
Then thereÂ´s another kind of revelation that got respect. Descartes who lived in the 1600s got respect, fame and was invited to live with the Queen of Sweden because he had gotten an idea which certainly told us something true. Revelations can either be con menÂ´s statements like they were from ape-man and forward, or they can actually claim something which is verifyably true. Descartes, propably having his mind overcrowded by the masses of revelations that had accumulated to his time, asked: â€œwhat would be true if all my statements were false?â€. What would remain if I tossed all my knowledge and ideas into the trash? Are we stuck with countless unverifyable statements, some contradicting eachother, not knowing which ones are true and which ones are not? Obviously not since statements about architecture are obviously true since they build houses, while contradictory statements do not. So Descartes dared to throw all his knowledge in the trash to see what remained. He found certain truth: that he exists â€“ because even if he was wrong or was being fooled in everything he thought to be true, thereÂ´d still be a â€œheâ€ there. He certainly exists no matter what. Same thing goes for thoughts: being wrong or being fooled is a thinking-process so even if he was wrong or was being fooled in everything he thought, thereÂ´d still be thought.
Socrates: So he figured out that he thinks and he exists.
God: These are not one statement â€“ they are two.
Socrates: What does that mean?
God: IÂ´ll tell you later â€“ just agree with me that there is distinction between thinker and thought â€“ that the statements are two. ItÂ´s building on certain truth, and itÂ´s possible to build a wholeâ€¦ whatever it is that â€œsaves the worldâ€ from the coming economic decline by having everyone build on certain truth until the God-debate is settled. Remembering â€œdistinctionâ€ (between thinker and thought) will prevent the horror-scenario of large-scale future wars between people group-bound by religions, and instead â€“ since everyone built a whole world-view on certain truth â€“ have a more stable decline in the future. â€œDistinctionâ€ i.e. remembering that there are two certain truths (thinker and thought) is a step on the way toward a plan that will save humanity from destroying itself as much as it would if we didnÂ´t build our world-views on certain truth.
Plato: So after an era of â€œrevelationâ€-revelations invented by anyone for whatever purpose, coming from DarwinÂ´s ape-manÂ´s revelations, Descartes, in the 1600s, invented a revelation â€“ certain truth: I think and I exist â€“ which got him invited to the Queen of Sweden for the rest of his life. People have always liked revelations and even verifyable truth-claims like DescartesÂ´ get respect.
God: I have set it as true that each one of you humans can verify in your own mindÂ´s eye that you do certainly exist and that there certainly is thought â€“ and thus there is distinction.
Darwin: Distinction is an abstract word. That two objects are separate/different from one another is one of those notions and ape-man never made into language â€“ there was never the evolutionary need to talk about â€œdistinctionâ€. Yes: one could say that one banana is different from another (and one wants the bigger one), but to have Distinction exist stand-alone as a distinct notion is abstract thinking and we are not evolved to do that. For millions of years the caveman word for â€œdistinctionâ€ was only used in a sentance â€“ not stand-alone as in â€œdistinction certainly exists because thinker and thought are both certain truthsâ€.
Chapter 3:
Distinction-antidistinction-opposition
The first proof for that the size-time-diagram is infinite is distinctionÂ´s (our) inability to see/represent anti-distinction.
Chapter 4:
Maximum size?
The second prooof for that the size-time-diagram is infinite is that if we imagine a partless anti-distinction then it has no distinction as in a â€œmaximumâ€ or â€œminimumâ€ size, i.e. the size-range is infinite.

Everyone agrees on that reality is one. Because itÂ´s one nothing can represent it, because the representer too should be part of reality. That means that there is a size-time-diagram which is infinite. And thatÂ´s why we exist. Everyone agrees on this eventhough we are distinct unique individuals. We have this world-view incommon, with extraterrestrials too.

The ultimate argument against God i.e. a new existential theory
You know for certain that you think and that you exist because in the event that you were being fooled (or threw all your knowledge in the trash) you would "think" because being fooled is a thinking-process and you would exist because "being fooled" implies that there is someone there who is being fooled
There is distinction between thinker and thought. There are separate entities. "Distinction" is one logical step from certain truth.
All is part of a single reality - "all as one" is anti-distinction (the opposite of distinction).
Can thinker or thought see anti-distinction? Can distinction represent anti-distinction? The opposites cannot catch one another.
Is there thus distinction in the form of a maximum or minimum size (or time) in anti-distinction? No, therefore size and time are infinite.
Another proof for that the size-range is infinite is that the universe defined "represents" infinitely vaguely, meaning that this
text
- in the eyes of God - is attempting to represent "that of which all is part"/reality as one, but fails because representation is distinction and reality is anti-distinction.
At every size you see energymass (existence) and spacetime (non-existence) as intertwined, as in E=mc
2
(where c
2
is spacetime). Because E=mc
2
is true in every size (including the smallest ones) the Big Bang gets summoned as dense when there is nothingness. Telescope observations show that nothingness is coming in the future again.
An infinite size-range of energymasspacetime and distinction-anti-distinction explains our existence better than God.
A size-time diagram with evolution originating in the middle of the known size-range.
You know for certain that you think and that you exist because even if an almighty demon was fooling you in everything you can possibly be fooled in, the fooling itself is a thought-process and therefore you know that thought exists (you think), and for you to be fooled you have to exist and therefore you know "I exist". Being fooled is thinking and a thinker is necessary for there to be someone to be fooled. So you know: no matter what, you think and you exist. Those are two things, right? TheyÂ´re both part of the same brain and the thought-process can become the analytical toolkit/thinker, but still we recognize that there are distinct entities - there is distinction. This can also be called separation. What is distinctionÂ´s opposite, anti-distinction? ItÂ´s one reality; that of which all is part; itÂ´s one and realityÂ´s definition in the dictionary is that all is part of it. If we write distinction (thinker and thought) on the left side of the paper and anti-distinction (reality; that of which all is part; one) on the right side of the paper - can the left side see the right side? No, because of opposition between distinction and anti-distinction. Because of there always being an observer (a thinker) and thus distinction in every observation and thus anti-distinction canÂ´t be represented/seen.
The brain evolved to deal with natural occurances - there was never an event in history where something invisible was to be contemplated and dealt with. Thus we seem to assume that the thought-process went wrong when we say that distinction/us canÂ´t see anti-distinction/reality. But the thought-process didnÂ´t go wrong: all that it means is that there is more to reality than can be represented. Regardless of how vaguely "represents" is defined, say a coffee cup - regardless of brains being involved - is assumed to try to represent that of which all is part, then anti-dinstinction - distinction - opposition (the opposition between distinction and itÂ´s opposite) makes the representation incorrect. We can ask if there in an anti-distinct "thing" is a maximum size and thus distinction? No. Likewise, another proof for that the size-range is infinite is that we do sense something (our everyday world) and can make hypotheses ad infinitum, and yet nothing represent
s ALL OF reality. Reality i.e. s
ize-time thus is infinite.
The infinite size-range is one pillar in the existential theory. Another pillar is energymass and spacetime being opposites but intertwined as in E=mc
2
(where c
2
refers to a speed which is space over time: spacetime). Multiplication joins energymass together with spacetime; nothing together with something/everything; existence together with non-existence. Why is there existence the shape of my body? Without going into the historical answer, one can explain it by saying that the body is something in (intertwined with) nothing, of a size in an infinite size-range (where the relationship between any two sizes (or objects of two sizes) i
s that they make sense of i.e. j
ustify one another). Then there too, as a third pillar, is distinction-an
ti-distinction-opposition i.e. w
e live in a single (not plural) reality but we see distinct/separate entities such as thinker and thought.
Speaking of spacetime, spacetime is the logical starting point for the time-based existential theory.
Nothingness (empty space) needs n
o prior justification nor reason to exist, because it doesnÂ´t exist. In it, however
, laws of nature are true i.e. i
t is not irrational / anti-logical, and among the many laws of nature there are those, including E=mc
2
, which mention energymass.
Could energymass be "mentioned" without it existing? If yes, it would be absurd / anti-logical. Why would reality mention things that never exist? But since laws of nature are firm and because of our rule "what is mentioned must exist or must be summoned" we get, wherever (in the smallest spaces) that E=mc
2
is mentioned, existence and thus dense existence: a big bang. The fact that galaxies are speeding away acceleratingly from one another leads to nothingness in the future, and with the middleman "laws of nature" again energymass is summoned as dense as can be. No time-delay between nothingness - laws of nature - energymass but as soon as a bordered (by event horizons which are determined by the finite speed of light) region becomes nothingness, a big bang occurs and eventually becomes nothingness bordered by event horizons again. This is the time-wise description of why energymass (which exists intertwined with spacetime as in E=mc
2
) starts dense and becomes nothingness, and repeats.
All of the above is a rival theory to "God created earth in 6 days and rested on the 7th". It is unintuitive because it deals with things we didnÂ´t have to deal with in evolution: invisible energymasspacetime/reality/anti-distinction as a part of reasoning. It also has a multi-reason cause for our existence: a time-wise rationale involving the beginning and end of the big bang combined with a 3-pillar existential theory which justifies size and energymass. It is abstract/scientific but canÂ´t be reduced into simpler terms. ItÂ´s the lowest common denominator that everyone can believe in (regardless of religion).
How many is reality? One. How many is Allah? One. Can anything completely represent reality? No. Can anything completely represent Allah? No. Is reality the greatest (if all is part of it)? Yes. Is â€œAllah akbarâ€? Yes. Reality and Allah have these three things incommon â€“ so maybe reality is synonymous with Allah?
How vaguely has reality defined â€to representâ€?
Infinitely vaguely â€“ anything can represent anything.
Is the representation/representer reality or Allah?
No.
Can anything represent that of which all is part?
No.
Then the size-time-diagram is infinite i.e. nothing represents reality. How many is it? How many is Allah? 1.
Did it sayâ€¦, or did it wri
te a book?
This disproves Allah writing the Quran.
Again: how much of reality can be represented by, say, a painting? The whole of it?
No, the whole of reality cannot be represented. Just like Allah canÂ´t be captured in a picture/word.
We can have hypotheses â€“ how many hypotheses can we have?
If reality is sizes & times, energymass and spacetime then the square-shaped size-time-diagram with energymasspacetime in each coordinate is the universal way to represent all there is to represent.
Does it write books? No, it is not of such authorship-kind nature.
â€œGod said to Muhammed word by wordâ€¦â€ is thus a false or at most metaphorical statement.
â€œYou have to do rituals in order not to go to hell, and in heaven you get 72 virginsâ€ is by the same logic also a false claim.
There are three alternatives as the foundation for this logic â€“ can you think of a 4
th
one?
1: Reality is a synonym for Allah
2: or Allah doesnÂ´t exist
3: or there are 72 virgins (not an alternative because reality is not of the nature, because it is size-time-energymasspacetime, to write books).
In addition to the square size-time diagram with infinity symbols in each of itÂ´s corners, and the evolutionary triangle which designates that life becomes more complex as time goes on
(the triangle originates at the central size of the known size-range), there is the following brain diagram:
You have a composite certain truth consisting of two certain truths: you can claim as certain that you think (because if you were being fooled: being fooled is thinking) and that you exist (because being fooled requires the one who is fooled to be there). I think and I exist is one statement but two truths. You can certainly claim to have â€œdistinctionâ€ because youÂ´re dealing
with multiple separate distinct entities (such as â€œIâ€ and â€œthoughtâ€). One could put it, while seeing the certain truths â€œI thinkâ€ and â€œI existâ€, that the space between the two notions (thinker and thought) is the hallmark of distinction. The distance separating thinker from thought we can recognize as necessary for â€œdistinctionâ€ to be concluded as a certain truth arising, in a next logical step, from the original primary certain truth.
Are all distinct entities part of a single reality if â€œrealityâ€ is defined as â€œthat of which all is partâ€? In other words: if we draw distinction on the left side of a paper and anti-distinction (distinctionÂ´s opposite: a singular reality â€“ that of which all is part. Zooming out summarizing maximally) on the right side of the paper, then can distinction represent the right side of the paper i.e. anti-distinction? How could some distinct entities depict the very opposite of what representation/distinction is? Any depiction/representation of anti-distinction/reality has at least three entities: thinker, space between thinker and thought, and thought. Separation/distinction is inherent in representation, thus anti-distinction is unrepresentable.
How vaguely has the universe/God defined what a representation is i.e. when a representation occurs? Our brains use neurons to represent, but what if â€“ instead of neurons (regardless of brains) â€“ the universe wills that any random object can be said to, as neurons do, represent reality? The universe has defined â€œrepresentationâ€ infinitely vaguely i.e. disregarding brains, any random object spontaneously is the symbol standing for all of reality â€“ because the universe defines â€œrepresentsâ€ infinitely vaguely. Despite the infinitely vague definition of what represents what, distinction-anti-distinction-opposition (the line separating the left side of the paper from the right side; the countering of distinction with anti-distinction) means that reality is not representable. If reality is anti-distinction then no distinction (representation is inherently distinction) can even, despite an infinitely vague definition of â€œrepresentsâ€, capture reality.
In
representations we can count at least three things and what weÂ´re trying to capture is one thing with nothing outside it. The fact that representations contain distinction makes capturing reality (all is one) impossible.
We can have infinitely many or infinitely large/substancefull representations/hypotheses â€“ such as an infinite size-time-diagram â€“ and though abstractly accurately pointing to reality, the universeÂ´s rule that nothing represents reality despite infinitely vaguely allowed representations of infinitely much, makes reality unrepresentable. This can only mean one thing: reality â€“ which we know as sizes and times (a size-time-diagram) â€“ is infinite. ThereÂ´s infinitely large and infinitely small with infinitely much past and infinitely much future. This square-shaped size-time-diagram i.e. our everyday experience of size-time has infinities all-over the place.
Energymass in spacetime: one in zero, existence in non-existence, something in nothing â€“ as defined by E=mc
2
where c
2
stands for speed (distance over time i.e. spacetime/zero/non-existence) and E=m referring to energymass (existence, something, all).
Distinction-anti-distinction-opposition: we live in a singular reality but we see multiple objects.
An infinite size-range.
The above three ideas are an existential theory (a theory which explains the existence of a reproducing shape and thus the dawn of evolution and thus our existence). It is modern to utilize three equal ideas to explain oneÂ´s existence â€“ all previous existential theories used either a single idea (monotheism) or a saga (multiple mundane (not very scientific/abstract) ideas) to explain existence.
The predictive quality that makes this existential theory a scientific theory is that it, basing it off an infinite size-range of energymasspacetime and distinction-anti-distinction-opposition, predicts that in an infinite size-range there ought to be a size where reproduction occurs. The existential theory predicts the first DNA, and from there we get to the evolutionary theory.
Another predictive quality is that the theory predicts a
dense
Big Bang. The a priori beginning of the universe logically is emptiness because emptiness doesnÂ´t need any prior logical justification for its existence because it doesnÂ´t exist. In emptiness laws of nature are true, such as the laws pointing toward and handleing energymass (like E=mc
2
), and thus the Big Bang begins infinitely dense because E=mc
2
is equally true simultaneously in the smallest of spaces. Tiny empty spaces having E=mc
2
be true in them simultaneously and directly as there was nothingness predicts a dense Big Bang. A region, contained within event horizons made out of energymasses speeding away at >c (due to dark energy causing accelerating cosmic expansion), is by definition â€œnothingâ€ in which E=mc
2
being true in the tiniest spaces summons a dense big bang out of reach of the closest (v = >c) energymass. Nothingness (out of reach for the closest energymasses because they are speeding away at >c) is summoned in the central point with event horizons as the furthest away border, causing Big Bang (due to laws of nature summoning energymass in the empty center).
The theory of evolution begins with the first reproducing shape. It was a shape that assembled surrounding mass into a similar shape. The existential theory predicts the existence of infinitely many such shapes. What inevitable becomes true when you have reproduction is that some die and some survive (life and death), that the number of offspring that shape make matters and that there is mutations over time. This is true about the shapeÂ´s offspring: some will die and some will survive, the number of offspring they make matters and the offspring can be different from the original shape. These three rules / laws of nature were inactive before the first reproduction occurred. The next main event was that one of these shapes found that if it injected its DNA into other shapesÂ´ reproductive mechanism, it exploited principle number two: that the number of offspring matters. It was the first virus: it hijacked othersÂ´ reproduction. The rule / law of nature that came into play with this event was that "power" matters: hijacking othersÂ´ reproductive mechanism gives evolutionary benefits. Now weÂ´ve listed the four main rules that govern evolutionary theory: first came the three first, and then came the forth: power. The next main event - to guard against viruses taking over all life / reproductive mechanisms - was that an immune system evolved to protect against virusÂ´ hijack attempts. This required multicellularism. Just like immune systems prompt/require multicellularism, immune systems prompt/require multigenderedism: to win in the arms race against quickly mutating viruses two genders arose to amplify the mutations to the immune system. Mixing genes from two genders creates a more mutated immune system, which can keep ahead in the arms race against quickly-mutating viruses "trying" to mutate to bypass any immune system. The next main event is that one of these multicellular organisms - a fish or worm - of the male gender mutated to be ag
g
ressive and defeat other males in battle. He wouldÂ´ve gotten access to many more females than his non-ag
g
ressive counter-parts. This too can be called "power" because the ag
g
ressive male hijacks other maleÂ´s access to females by killing the males. This prompts the dinosaurs because larger muscle mass and shaper weaponry is better at killing off competitors. Amongst the dinosaurs there was the mother-offspring bond, placed there by evolution for the evolutionary benefits a mother gets from seeing an offspring survive to adulthood. This bond mutated to involve flock-members because a group working together out-competes any individualists when fighting over anything. The next main event was that someone mapped the flock, in his brain, as a hierarchy (up-down-axis) with the longing to
be the top of the hierarchy. This capitalist striving for
the top made brains grew larger â€“ larger memory-banks, more accurate predictions and faster planning are all advantages coming
from a larger cortex.
Power lead men to accumulate resources â€“ the very resources females needed for their children. Females care most about their children because they pass on their genes, so in finding a male they aim for loyalty plus status/power/placement in the hierarchy. Females think a lot about how others â€“ especially suitors â€“ perceive them and therefore males evolved the subconscious mechanism, to keep womenâ€™sÂ´ attention, to push-pull i.e. to, in one coherent fluent conversation, both say negative feedback about the woman and positive feedback.
It is a major historical event that there finally is an atheistic argument that is sh
aped like a university course: i
t is an existential theory plus evolution which not only doesnÂ´t need a personified god to function, but the pillars (infinite sizerange of energymasspacetime and distinction-anti-distinction-opposition) canÂ´t have a personified god added to them as a 4th pillar without the theory sounding ridicilous. Not only does the theory not need a personified god but adding a god destroys the minimalistic rationally complete beauty of the theory. Gods uglify the theory. The dawn of the theory is a major historical event because never before has an entire course (beginning with certain truth, going through the existential theory and ending in evolution) been laid out in the intellectual debate of atheism, as an argument against a personified god.
The anatomy in the brain from hearing certain truth (I think & I am) - the beginning of the course - creates the same neuronal pathways / associations between ideas in every single person who knows certain truth. The logical step to "distinction" is noting, as a meta-analysis of the primary certain truth, that one has many ideas (I think AND I am) and that one can take logical pathways to the next step in the course (distinction exists). Then juxtaposing anti-distinction with distinction creates the unseeable - "defying reason" (because reason is, in simple people, only visual) - conclusion that we/distinction cannot see reality/anti-distinction. The distinction-anti-distinction-opposition is hard to grasp because it - like formal logic or math - uses words instead of pictures (the linguistic brainhalf rather than the visual one). We evolved to be like "if I see it I believe it" and that was a good heuristic (rule of thumb) because practical sequences of events can be verified as true or untrue by visualizing them. But in this philosophy: no - it has to be linguistic that we deny ourselves the concept "all of reality", leading to the conclusion that there is more to reality than anything - however vaguely the universe has defined "represent" - can represent. This adds infinitely many sizes to our abstract size-range / size-time-diagram; it makes a square (with size on the y-axis and time on the x-axis) with infinity symbols in each corner, which in turn becomes a pillar in our personified-god-denying existential theory.
To come from certain truth, through mere logical steps (meta-analyses and juxtaposition of opposites), to an existential theory which predicts evolution is a major historical event in the history of atheism.
In a historical context the anatomy (neural connections between ideas and sequences of logic) created by this course is like a paradigm-shift into a new era of earth society - an era similar to
that existent on infinitely many other planets who have come further than our midway-mark in a regular water-bearing planetÂ´s history.
Evolution, by beginning with "a mass that can assemble surrounding mass into a similar shape" steps forth from the existential theoryÂ´s infinite size-range of energymasspacetime. Assuming DNA is the replication-molecule, we can step - skipping over how cell walls evolved etc - to the fact that viruses mutate to hijack othersÂ´ reproductive system. This - in this universal inter-planetary extraterrestrial culture - is formulated, in books of logic, as first three rules arising (life/death, number of offspring matters and "there is mutation in each generation-shift") and then a forth rule arising (power, with viruses). This story - which in our course begins from a first reproducing shape and ends with finessing the anatomy of power in men - is visualizable like the caveman story-telling narratives we evolved to hear/see. We can proof-check its validity/possibility by following the narrative visually. The visual nature of evolution is in stark contrast to the purely linguistic/abstract nature of the existential theory.
Speaking o
f "abstract" descriptions i.e. d
escriptions that make it very clear to us that our understanding of the universe is a mere map (a reference) and not reality itself (mind you of PlatoÂ´s or KantÂ´s cave-metaphor and "the thing is not the thing itself" -philosophies)... The size-range of energymasspacetime,
at the size of quantum physics
has us describe photons etc using both the wave-description which focu
s
es on lengths of space (this is the "spacetime description") AND - in wave-particle duality - the energymass description that the energy of a photon is its color. Color (as perceived through the eyes), wave/spacetime-description and particle-energy/energymass-description all are valid descriptors of quantum particles. This ability of ours to describe any mass/phenomenon using both energymass- and spacetime-descriptions runs throughout the entire size-range. You can imagine two lines - one representing energymass and the other representing spacetime - running vertically through the pictures on the size-axis. Adding complexity to this, there is likewise two lines - gravity and electromagnetism - both running through the size-axis, gravity having itÂ´s duality of energymass and spacetime descriptions and electromagnetism too having both, in every level of the size-range, energymass and spacetime descriptions. Gravity is both Newtonian "masses pulling toward masses" (energymassÂ´ focus on mass) and Einsteinian "curvature of spacetime" (spacetimeÂ´s focus on space) - both descriptors are accurate.
From having read this book, the following should now be understandable:
Certain truth leads to the conclusion â€œdistinctionâ€, and simultaneously warrants an anti-distinction defined as â€œthat of which all is partâ€. The opposition between distinction and anti-distinction â€“ despite â€œrepresentationâ€ being ubiquitous (infinitely vaguely defined) â€“ together with the â€œmax size?â€-question asked in anti-distinction â€“ supports the fact that reality i.e. size-time is infinite. This then becomes our pillar in our existential theory that moves God away from a creator role. The two other pillars are energimasspacetime (found in E=mc
2
) and the opposition that we live in a singular reality yet see multiple things. From the middle of the known size-range (which itself is part of the infinite size-range) comes the tip of a triangle which symbolizes evolution. From evolution, then, comes the brain diagram with dopamine & serotonin across the visual and linguistic brainhalves, and a lower box which is our 3-category emotional repertoire; the most common 4 emotions in our idle society being power-hungryness (how to elevate oneself in the socioeconomic hierarchy if one is a man; and for females itÂ´s mapping the status-hierarchy of men in their social group as to find them
differently attractive), expanding oneÂ´s world-view, planning sex and planning resource-gathering/work. This makes for a multi-symbol diagram involving the existential theoryÂ´s three pillars holding up the square-triangle-brain (size-time-diagram, evolution, brain) diagram.
Certain truth is or leads to distinction, which itself â€“ as all distinct things are â€“ is part of anti-distinction. This is like saying obvious things about the reality/everyday world in front of us: such as that size is infinite and that it is something in nothing. All this, in turn, leads us to draw a square: a size-time diagram with infinity-symbols in all 4 corners. From the middle of the known size-range, then, comes a triangle â€“ evolution â€“ which ends up in the brain with serotonine, dopamine, two brainhalves, a cortex and an emotional repertoire (upper- and lower box). In the emotional repertoire there are 4 idle emotions, among them â€œseeking powerâ€ â€“ power here is defined as outcompeting other males (if oneself is male) in a status competition, but the principle of diminishing other malesÂ´ reproductive capabilities happened at several stages in evolution: males fighting males (growing bigger to become dinosaurs) or viruses hijacking reproductive mechanisms of single-celled organisms. The search for power thus has led to brain-size growing (when competing for upwardness in hierarchies) but also things like T-rexÂ´s claws or the 1918 flu â€“ not to mention war.
Previous atheists have moved God from a place where do intervenes in everyday life using miracles, to a God that set everything in motion but then doesnÂ´t intervene. My philosophy places God as a bum who watches a skyscraper get built â€“ the bum then gets praised for the skyscraper getting built even though the bum didnÂ´t contribute anything: at most he watched as other mechanisms got everything done. Or God is a football fan who cheers at the players but doesnÂ´t himself contribute to making goals. Natural mechanisms create the world â€“ no need to praise God.
We are half-way in a planetÂ´s history â€“ 4.5 billion years have passed and 5 billion remain. The theory you now know is, in other words, in cosmic majority â€“ more planets have it than not (if it takes approximately half of a planetÂ´s history to invent it and if it remains true for the rest of the planetÂ´s history). Most other planets i.e. the majority of extraterrestrials are ideological adherents of the theory. Spread this theory to get approval of the majority even though it lives light-years away. Currently 99.9% of the worldÂ´s population lives in the era of religions â€“ spread this theory to end religious wars and terrorism like 9/11. The world-view (the view/diagrams that explain the world) is the same in the cosmic majority.
IÂ´ve worked 10 years to invent this theory and as alone bearing it itÂ´s my responsibility that it spreads. The future civilization in which everyone has the same world-view thus is dependent on me. I feel a
unique ability to influence earthÂ´s future.
You, as one who has partaken of this rare knowledge, should also feel a responsibility about spreading it to change the world.
IÂ´ve talked about the emotional repertoire in the brain-diagram. If we were to genetically engineer (DNA-manipulate) a next generation, we would A) give it an incredible sense of humor and knowledge so it could entertain us, and/or B) make it a super-happy retard â€“ retarded because positive emotions donÂ´t motivate â€“ they pacify â€“ so super-happy is equal to looking like a mongoloid; needs and wants and everything that drives us is painful â€“ pain motivates while super-happiness pacifies. We would, by creating these DNA-engineered emotional repertoires (to accomplish the dual
goal of incredible happiness and incredible entertainers/comedians/philosophers), be doing something that is done on other planets â€“ these are universal engineering goals.
You know that gold plate we sent up into space for aliens to find? It had etched on it images of man, some music, some other picturesâ€¦ We didnÂ´t send up the diagram discussed in this book. If the aliens see the gold plate we did send up, theyÂ´ll read between the lines â€“ seeing that there is no universal diagram â€“ and conclude that: â€œon earth they still believe in godsâ€.
You know how most people dedicate a large part of their lives to religion? Once they understand my tattoo (diagram) theyÂ´ll ask themselves: â€œwhat the hell have I been praying to?â€ It resembles a tiny needle popping a big balloon.
If this book goes mainstream, the future becomes so interesting that one forgets oneÂ´s everyday problems.
Interesting important things relieve
anxiety
(especially when they contain humor like a universal tattoo).
Nazis were friends with Nazis, communists were friends with communists, USA was friends with USA, when jihadists meet they share the same ideology and thus bond quickly. My theory/ideology/religion-replacer is empathy-increasing.
The more things people agree upon the better.
In the diagram/tattoo there are about 16 â€œlinesâ€ (hundreds if we consider the emotional repertoire being drawn the same on other planets). The sport is to draw as many universal lines as possible â€“ drawn from science so they can be drawn from science anywhere in the infinite universe.
God is a war-motivator. They say â€œthere are no atheists in trenchholesâ€. You need a bit of God to do war.
ItÂ´s hard to be an atheist warrior. My book, by disproving god, thus makes motivation for war less.
Gods contribute nothing â€“ one will have the full human experience-repertoire without gods.
Rather no direction than the wrong direction â€“ gods only contribute to war; itÂ´s better to be tolerantly caveman, uncaring of ideologies/world-views, than to be religious.
It seems mean to say that â€œitÂ´s their fault that religious wars keep on going â€“ those that wonÂ´t studyâ€, but itÂ´s good marketing.
Accomplices.
This book is worth you reading if it solves (or significantly helps) a major problem.
It is good marketing of my book to outline
the problem that I solve here.
USA is better than war, right? USA has poor folks committing crime â€“ thatÂ´s far better than nations waring. I move the problem from a macro-scale where nations fight eachother over oil, to an individualistic/family-based/friendship-based micro-scale where everyone feels as ideological/religious comrades â€“ empathy and friendship-buildingly sharing the knowledge of this book. I can get everyone to have the same ideology/religion-replacement so that thereÂ´ll be no war over the oil that has made us rich enough to not witness babies dying every day. Nations, races, ideologies, religions â€“ large groups â€“ makes the difference between war and crime. I solve the problems of macro-war and the friendship problem once everyone knows my diagrams. The post-oil decline isnÂ´t going to be pretty but we can take all measures to alleviate it â€“ spread this book.
If God is defined as â€œthe reason for existenceâ€ and I present a complete existential theory as a diagram, and I tattoo the diagram on my arm, is my
tattoo
then God? No, just a symbol for the reason for existence. One can tattoo an explanatory model for existence and God has during thousands of years been defined as the cause for existence.
My philosophy is to be real (to have an accurate concept of reality) but talking to religious people is like drifting away into a novel â€“ itÂ´s fiction but it (in some people) is beautiful. The greatest qualm I have about publishing my science is that it strips away the beautiful fiction novel as well as the hideous terrorism.
Why is it that the correct existential theory (which presumably should only be a big bang-type theory) inevitably is an arguemtn against imaginary friends/lords? Couldnâ€™t God exist without having created the universe? God certainly didnÂ´t create the universe but religious people could have an imaginary friend despite that. A powerless god â€“ a pet god.
We have about 60 years to publish this science because after that the world economy starts going downhill and what today is â€œjustâ€ a trillion dollar thing (dealing with religion in the middle east) will become a clash of civilizations (as long as a billion people believe in the revealed word of Muhammed and form an anti-atheist group based on that). But imagine if I become known as the one who ended islam â€“ during the past 2 decades islam has cost USA 6 trillion dollars. If I end religious war for good and get a piece of the pie (some of what the world will save by not having religious war)â€¦
Ending religion might even have unforeseen consequences like if religion is a major brain-drain or if having a uniting global ideology spurs friendship so much so that the world needs less military spending.
If religion is ended tomorrow the USA can reduce its military spending because the main trouble-zone (the religious middle east) is gone (converted to atheism). A large US military in a world full of conflict is as powerful as a small US military in a world where my science is mainstream. The world is messed up because it lacks my science and that warrants a big US military presence. If my science was known the US would need as much global military reach as is needed between California and Oregon. 1 billion people reading a holy book which says that atheists should be killed warrants a big military presence.
A much smaller US military is sufficient to quell all atheist conflicts.
Every fool has said â€œif all people would think just like me thereÂ´d be world-peaceâ€ but I have the opportunity to say that for real because all people need to do is learn a page of new science.

Texten bÃ¶rjar med sÃ¤ker sanning, sedan gÃ¥r den till att fÃ¶rklara varfÃ¶r nÃ¥gonting existerar istÃ¤llet fÃ¶r ingenting (den existentiella teorin â€“ varfÃ¶r vi existerar), sedan gÃ¥r den till evolutionÃ¤r teori vilket fÃ¶rutsÃ¤gs av den existentiella teorin. Den evolutionÃ¤ra teorin fÃ¶rklarar vardagsfenomen.
Du vet med sÃ¤kerhet att du tÃ¤nker och att du existerar eftersom om du skulle bliva lurad av en allsmÃ¤ktig demon som fÃ¶rsÃ¶ker lura dig i allt du kan bli lurad i, sÃ¥ Ã¤r lurendrejeriet i sig en tanke-process och dÃ¤rfÃ¶r vet du att tankar existerar (du tÃ¤nker). FÃ¶r att du ska bli lurad sÃ¥ mÃ¥ste du existera och dÃ¤rfÃ¶r vet du â€jag existerarâ€. Att bli lurad Ã¤r en tankeprocess och tÃ¤nkaren Ã¤r nÃ¶dvÃ¤ndig fÃ¶r att det ska finnas nÃ¥gon som blir lurad. SÃ¥ du vet: oavsett vad sÃ¥ tÃ¤nker du och existerar du. Ã…vanstÃ¥ende Ã¤r tvÃ¥ saker, eller hur? De Ã¤r bÃ¥da del av samma hjÃ¤rna och samma tankeprocess kan bli ens analytiska verktygssats/tÃ¤nkare, men vi erkÃ¤nner Ã¤ndÃ¥ att det finns distinkta entiteter â€“ att det finns distinktion. Detta kan ocksÃ¥ kallas separation. Vad Ã¤r distinktions motsats, anti-distinktion? Det Ã¤r en verklighet; det som allt Ã¤r del av; den Ã¤r en och dess definition i ordboken Ã¤r att allt Ã¤r del av den. Om vi skriver distinktion (tÃ¤nkare och tanke) pÃ¥ vÃ¤nster sida av ett papper och anti-distinktion (verkligheten; det som allt Ã¤r del av; en) pÃ¥ hÃ¶ger sida av pappret â€“ kan den vÃ¤nstra sidan se den hÃ¶gra sidan? Nej, fÃ¶r att oppositionen mellan distinktion och anti-distinktion. Det finns alltid en observerare (tÃ¤nkaren) och dÃ¤rmed distinktion i varje observation och dÃ¤rmed kan anti-distinktion ej representeras/ses.
HjÃ¤rnan evolverade fÃ¶r att hantera naturliga fenomen â€“ det fanns aldrig ett scenario i historien dÃ¥ nÃ¥gonting osynligt behÃ¶vde hanteras och betÃ¤nkas. DÃ¤rfÃ¶r antar vi att tanke-processen blev fel nÃ¤r vi sÃ¤ger att distinktion/vi inte kan se anti-distinktion/verkligheten. Men tankeprocessen gick inte fel: allt det betyder Ã¤r att det finns mer till verkligheten Ã¤n kan representeras. Oavsett hur vagt â€representerasâ€ Ã¤r definierat, lÃ¥t oss sÃ¤ga att en kaffekopp â€“ oavsett om hjÃ¤rnor Ã¤r involverade eller inte â€“ antas fÃ¶rsÃ¶ka representera det som allt Ã¤r del av, dÃ¥ gÃ¶r anti-distinktions-distinktions-oppositionen (motsÃ¤ttningen mellan distinktion och dess motsats) att representationen Ã¤r inkorrekt. Vi kan frÃ¥ga om en anti-distinkt â€sakâ€ har en maximumstorlek och dÃ¤rmed distinktion? Nej. PÃ¥ samma not Ã¤r ett annat bevis fÃ¶r att storleksskalan Ã¤r oÃ¤ndlig Ã¤r att vi ser nÃ¥gonting (vÃ¥r vardagsvÃ¤rld) samt kan gÃ¶ra hypoteser ad infinitum, och Ã¤ndÃ¥ representerar ingenting ALL verklighet. Verkligheten dvs storlek-tid Ã¤r dÃ¤rfÃ¶r oÃ¤ndligt.
En oÃ¤ndlig storleksskala Ã¤r en av pelarna i den existentiella teorin. En annan pelare Ã¤r att energimassa och rumtid Ã¤r motsatser (opposition) men sammanflÃ¤tade sÃ¥som i E=mc
2
(dÃ¤r c
2
hÃ¤nvisar till en hastighet dvs rum Ã¶ver tid: rumtid). Multiplikationen sammanfÃ¶r energimassa tillsammans med rumtid; ingenting tillsammans med nÃ¥gonting/allting; existens tillsammans med icke-existens. VarfÃ¶r finns det existens i form av min kropp? Utan att gÃ¥ in i det historiska svaret sÃ¥ kan man fÃ¶rklara det genom att sÃ¤ga att kroppen Ã¤r nÃ¥gonting i (sammanflÃ¤tat med) ingenting, av en storlek i en oÃ¤ndlig storleks-skala (dÃ¤r relationen mellan vilka tvÃ¥ storlekar som helst (eller objekt av tvÃ¥ storlekar) Ã¤r att de Ã¤r fÃ¶rklaringen till varandra dvs rÃ¤ttfÃ¤rdigar varandra. Sedan finns det ocksÃ¥, som tredje pelare, distinktions-anti-distinktions-opposition dvs vi lever i en singular (ej plural) verklighet men ser distinkta/separata entiteter sÃ¥som tÃ¤nkare och tanke.
PÃ¥ tal om rumtid, rumtid Ã¤r den logiska startpunkten fÃ¶r den tidsbaserade existentiella teorin. Ingenting (tom rumtid) behÃ¶ver inget inledande/tidigare rÃ¤ttfÃ¤rdigande eller anledning att existera, fÃ¶r att det existerar inte. I den, hursomhelst, Ã¤r naturlagarna sanna dvs den Ã¤r inte irrationell / anti-logisk, och bland naturlagarna finns de som, inklusive E=mc
2
, som nÃ¤mner energimassa. Skulle energimassa kunna â€nÃ¤mnasâ€ utan att det skulle existera? Om â€jaâ€ sÃ¥ skulle det vara absurt / anti-logiskt. VarfÃ¶r skulle verkligheten nÃ¤mna saker som aldrig existerar? Eftersom naturlagarna Ã¤r strikta och tack vare vÃ¥r regel â€det som nÃ¤mns mÃ¥ste existera eller uppstÃ¥â€ sÃ¥ fÃ¥r vi, varÃ¤n (i de minsta storlekarna) dÃ¤r E=mc
2
nÃ¤mns, sÃ¥ finns existens och dÃ¤rfÃ¶r en tÃ¤t big bang. Faktumet att galaxer rusar ivÃ¤g accelererandes frÃ¥n varandra leder till ingenting (tom rymd) i framtiden, och med mellanhanden â€naturlagarâ€ sÃ¥ uppstÃ¥r energimassa igen sÃ¥ tÃ¤t som den kan vara. Ingen tids-delay mellan ingenting â€“ naturlagar â€“ energimassa men sÃ¥ snart en begrÃ¤nsad (av event-horizons som bestÃ¤ms av ljuset Ã¤ndliga hastighet) region blir ingenting/tomrum, sÃ¥ uppstÃ¥r en big bang som sedan genom kosmisk expansion blir ingenting igen, som sedan blir tomrum och en ny big bang igen. Detta Ã¤r den tidsmÃ¤ssiga beskrivningen om varfÃ¶r energimassa (som existerar sammanflÃ¤tad med rumtid sÃ¥som i E=mc
2
) bÃ¶rjar tÃ¤t och blir ingenting, och sedan repetitation.
Det Ã¥vanstÃ¥ende Ã¤r en rivalteori till â€Gud skapade jorden pÃ¥ 6 dagar och vilade pÃ¥ den sjundeâ€. Den Ã¤r inte intuitiv eftersom den har att gÃ¶ra med saker som vi inte hade att gÃ¶ra med under evolutionen: osynliga energimassarumtid/verkligheten/anti-distinktion som del av vÃ¥rt resonemang. Den har ocksÃ¥ en multi-anledning orsak fÃ¶r vÃ¥r existens: en tidsvis rationale involverandes bÃ¶rjan och slutet pÃ¥ big bang, kombinerad med en 3-pelares existentiell teori som rÃ¤ttfÃ¤rdigar storlek och energimassa. Den Ã¤r abstrakt/vetenskaplig men kan inte reduceras till simplare termer. Det Ã¤r den minsta gemensamma nÃ¤mnaren som alla kan tro pÃ¥ (oavsett religion).
Hur vagt har verkligheten definerat â€att representeraâ€?
OÃ¤ndligt vagt â€“ vad som helst kan representera vad som helst.
Ã„r representationen/representÃ¶ren verkligheten eller Allah?
Nej.
Kan nÃ¥gonting representera det som allt Ã¤r del av?
Nej.
DÃ¥ Ã¤r storleks-tids-diagrammet oÃ¤ndligt dvs inget representerar verkligheten. Hur mÃ¥nga Ã¤r den? Hur mÃ¥nga Ã¤r Allah? 1.
Sa denâ€¦, eller skrev den en bok?
Detta motbevisar att Allah skrev en bok.
Igen: hur mycket av verkligheten kan representeras av, sÃ¤g, en mÃ¥lning? All den?
Nej, hela verkligheten kan ej representeras. Precis som Allah inte kan fÃ¥ngas i ett ord/en bild.
Vi kan ha hypoteser â€“ hur mÃ¥nga hypoteser kan vi ha?
Om verkligheten Ã¤r storlekar och tider, energimassa och rumtid sÃ¥ Ã¤r det rektangulÃ¤ra storleks-tids-diagrammet med energimassarumtid i varje koordinat det universella sÃ¤ttet att representera allt som finns att representera.
Skriver den bÃ¶cker? Nej, den Ã¤r inte av fÃ¶rfattarnatur.
â€Gud sa till Muhammed ord fÃ¶r ordâ€¦â€ Ã¤r alltsÃ¥ ett falskt eller som mest ett metaforiskt pÃ¥stÃ¥ende.
â€Du mÃ¥ste gÃ¶ra ritualer fÃ¶r att inte hamna i helvetet, och i himmelen fÃ¥r du 72 oskulderâ€ Ã¤r med samma logik ocksÃ¥ ett falskt pÃ¥stÃ¥ende.
Det finns tre alternativ som fundament fÃ¶r denna logik â€“ kan du tÃ¤nka ut ett fjÃ¤rde?
1: Verkligheten Ã¤r ett synonym fÃ¶r Allah,
2: eller sÃ¥ finns inte Allah
3: eller sÃ¥ finns 72 oskulder (ej ett alternativ eftersom verkligheten inte Ã¤r av den naturen, dÃ¥ den Ã¤r storleks-tids-energimassarumtid, att den skriver bÃ¶cker).
Som tillÃ¤gg till det rektangulÃ¤ra storleks-tids-diagrammet med oÃ¤ndlighetssymboler i varje hÃ¶rn, och den evolutionÃ¤ra triangeln som representerar att livet blev mer komplext ju mer tiden gick (triangelns spets har sitt ursprung i mittersta storleken i den kÃ¤nda storleksskalan), finns fÃ¶ljande hjÃ¤rn-diagram:
Den existentiella teorin med dess tre pelare, dvs en oÃ¤ndlig storleksskala, energimassarumtid och distinktions-anti-distinktions-opposition, fÃ¶rutsÃ¤ger att det borde finnas en liten bit DNA som kopierar sig.
Evolutionsteorin bÃ¶rjar med den fÃ¶rsta reproducerande formen. Det var en form som samlande kringliggande massa till en liknande form. Den existentiella teorin fÃ¶rutsÃ¤ger existensen av oÃ¤ndligt mÃ¥nga sÃ¥dana former. Det som oundvikligen blir sant nÃ¤r man har reproduktion Ã¤r att vissa dÃ¶r medan andra Ã¶verlever (liv och dÃ¶d), att antalet avkomma/kopior formen gÃ¶r har betydelse och att det finns mutationer Ã¶ver tid. FÃ¶ljande Ã¤r sant om formens avkomma: vissa dÃ¶r medan andra Ã¶verlever, antalet avkomma har betydelse och avkomman Ã¤r annorlunda frÃ¥n originalformen. Dessa tre regler / naturlagar var inaktiva innan den fÃ¶rsta reproduktionen skedde. NÃ¤sta stora steg var nÃ¤r ett av dessa former mÃ¶jliggjorde fÃ¶r sig sjÃ¤lv att injicera sitt DNA in i andra formers reproduktiva mekanism, vilket utnyttjade princip nr 2: att antalet avkomma har betydelse. Det var det fÃ¶rsta viruset: den hijackade andras reproduktion. Regeln / naturlagen som kom i spel i.om. denna hÃ¤ndelse var att â€maktâ€ har betydelse: att hijacka andras reproduktiva mekanism ger evolutionÃ¤ra fÃ¶rdelar. Nu har vi lagt fram de fyra huvudregelerna som Ã¤r evolutionsteori: fÃ¶rst kom de tre fÃ¶rsta reglerna, sedan kom den fjÃ¤rde: makt. NÃ¤sta stora hÃ¤ndelse â€“ fÃ¶r att skydda mot att virus hijackar alla reproduktiva system â€“ var att ett immunsystem evolverade fÃ¶r att skydda mot virus hijacks-fÃ¶rsÃ¶k. Detta behÃ¶vde multicellulÃ¤rism. Precis som immunsystem krÃ¤ver multicellularism, sÃ¥ behÃ¶ver immunsystem multikÃ¶nadhet: fÃ¶r att vinna i kampen dÃ¤r virus muterar fÃ¶r att kringgÃ¥ immunsystem sÃ¥ behÃ¶ver immunsystemet ocksÃ¥ maximalt med mutation. Att mixa gener frÃ¥n tvÃ¥ kÃ¶n skapar ett mer muterat immunsystem, vilket hÃ¥ller ut i kampen mot virus dÃ¤r virus â€fÃ¶rsÃ¶kerâ€ mutera sig runt immunsystemet. Den nÃ¤sta stora hÃ¤ndelsen var att en av dessa multicellulÃ¤ra organismer â€“ en fisk eller mask â€“ av det manliga kÃ¶net muterade till att vara agressiv och fÃ¶rinta andra manliga varelser. Han skulle ha fÃ¥tt hÃ¶gre tillgÃ¥ng till kvinnliga organismer jÃ¤mfÃ¶rt med hans icke-agressiva likar. Detta kan ocksÃ¥ kallas â€maktâ€ eftersom agressiva hanar hijackar andra hanars tillgÃ¥ng till kvinnor genom att dÃ¶da hanarna. Detta orsakar dinosaurierna eftersom stÃ¶rre muskelmassa och skarpare vapen Ã¤r bÃ¤ttre pÃ¥ att dÃ¶da rivalerna. Bland dinosaurierna fanns moder-avkomma-bandet, ditplacerad av evolutionen eftersom det var en fÃ¶rdel fÃ¶r mÃ¶drar att se sina barn Ã¶verleva till vuxenskap. Detta band muterade till att involvera flock-medlemmar eftersom en grupp sammarbetandes bÃ¤ttre kan vinna Ã¶ver individualister i brÃ¥k om vad som helst. NÃ¤sta stora steg var att nÃ¥gon kartlade flocken, i sin hjÃ¤rna, som en hierarki (upp-ned-axeln) med en lÃ¤ngtan efter att stÃ¥ hÃ¶gst upp i hierarkin. Denna kapitalistiska tÃ¤vlan mot toppen gjorde att hjÃ¤rnan vÃ¤xte sig stÃ¶rre â€“ stÃ¶rre minnesbank, mer detaljrika fÃ¶rutsÃ¤gelser och snabbare planering Ã¤r alla fÃ¶rdelar som kommer frÃ¥n att ha ett stÃ¶rre kortex.
Du har en komposit-sÃ¤ker sanning bestÃ¥endes av tvÃ¥ sÃ¤kra sanningar: du kan med sÃ¤kerhet sÃ¤ga att du tÃ¤nker (fÃ¶r att om du skulle bli lurad: att bli lurad Ã¤r en tankeprocess) och att du existerar (eftersom att bli lurad krÃ¤ver den som blir lurad). Jag tÃ¤nker och jag finns Ã¤r ett pÃ¥stÃ¥ende men tvÃ¥ sanningar. Du kan med sÃ¤kerhet pÃ¥stÃ¥ dig ha â€distinktionâ€ eftersom du har att gÃ¶ra med multipla separata entiteter (sÃ¥som â€jagâ€ och â€tankarâ€). Man kan sÃ¤ga, nÃ¤r man ser den sÃ¤kra sanningens â€jag tÃ¤nkerâ€ och â€jag existerarâ€, att avstÃ¥endet/mellanrummet mellan de tvÃ¥ idÃ©erna (tÃ¤nkare och tanke) Ã¤r distinktion. AvstÃ¥endet/mellanrummet som separarar tÃ¤nkare frÃ¥n tanke Ã¤r nÃ¶dvÃ¤ndigt fÃ¶r â€disktinktionâ€ att hÃ¤rledas som sÃ¤ker sanning fÃ¶ljandes ur nÃ¤sta logiska steg, med ursprunget av den originella primÃ¤ra sÃ¤kra sanningen.
Ã„r alla distinkta entiteter del av en singulÃ¤r verklighet om â€verklighetenâ€ Ã¤r definierad som â€det som allt Ã¤r del avâ€? Med andra ord: om vi ritar distinktion pÃ¥ vÃ¤nster sida av ett papper och anti-distinktion (distinktionÂ´s motsats: en ensam verklighet â€“ det som allt Ã¤r del av. Zoomandes ut maximalt) pÃ¥ hÃ¶ger sida av pappret, kan dÃ¥ distinktion representera hÃ¶ger sida av pappret dvs anti-distinktion? Hur skulle nÃ¥gon distinkt entitet kunna vara/representera motsatsen till vad representation/distinktion Ã¤r? Vilken representation som helst av anti-distinktion/verkligheten mÃ¥ste ha minst tre entiteter: tÃ¤nkare, mellanrummet mellan tÃ¤nkare och tanke, och tanke.
Separation/distinktion Ã¤r antaget i representation, vilket innebÃ¤r att anti-distinktion Ã¤r orepreserbart.
Hur vagt har universum/Gud definerat vad en representation Ã¤r dvs nÃ¤r en representation sker? VÃ¥ra hjÃ¤rnor anvÃ¤nder neuroner fÃ¶r att representera, men vad sÃ¤gs om â€“ istÃ¤llet fÃ¶r neuroner (oavsett om hjÃ¤rnor Ã¤r inblandade eller inte) â€“ universum lÃ¥ter vilket slumpmÃ¤ssigt valt objekt som helst lÃ¥ta sig sÃ¤gas, sÃ¥som neuroner sÃ¤gs, representera verkligheten? Universum har definierat â€representationâ€ oÃ¤ndligt vagt dvs uteslutandes hjÃ¤rnor sÃ¥ kan vilket slumpmÃ¤ssigt objekt som helst spotant bli/vara symbolen fÃ¶r all verklighet â€“ fÃ¶r att universum har definierat â€representeraâ€ oÃ¤ndligt vagt. Trots den oÃ¤ndligt vaga definitionen av vad som representerar vad, sÃ¥ gÃ¶r distinktions-anti-distinktions-oppositionen (linjen som separerar vÃ¤nster sida av pappret frÃ¥n hÃ¶ger sida; motsÃ¤ttningen mellan distinktion och anti-distinktion) att verkligheten Ã¤r orepresenterbar. Om verkligheten Ã¤r anti-distinktion dÃ¥ finns ingen distinktion (representation Ã¤r oundvikligen distinktion), trots universums oÃ¤ndligt vaga definition av â€representeraâ€, fÃ¥nga verkligheten. I representationer kan vi rÃ¤kna minst tre saker och det vi fÃ¶rsÃ¶ker representera Ã¤r en sak utan nÃ¥gonting utanfÃ¶r den. Faktumet att representationer innehÃ¥ller distinktion gÃ¶r att att fÃ¥nga verkligheten (allt som ett) omÃ¶jligt.
Vi kan ha oÃ¤ndligt mÃ¥nga eller oÃ¤ndligt innehÃ¥llsfulla/stora representationer/hypoteser â€“ sÃ¥som ett oÃ¤ndligt storleks-tids-diagram â€“ och genom att abstrakt peka till verkligheten, sÃ¥ gÃ¶r universums regel att ingenting representerar verkligheten trots universums oÃ¤ndligt vaga definition av â€representeraâ€ av oÃ¤ndligt mycket, gÃ¶r verkligheten orepresenterbar. Detta kan bara betyda en sak: verkligheten â€“ som vi kÃ¤nner som storlekar och tider (ett storleks-tids-diagram) â€“ Ã¤r oÃ¤ndligt. Det finns oÃ¤ndligt stort och oÃ¤ndligt litet med oÃ¤ndligt mycket dÃ¥tid och oÃ¤ndligt mycket framtid. Detta rektangulÃ¤ra storleks-tids-diagram dvs vÃ¥r vardagsvÃ¤rld av storlek-tid har oÃ¤ndligheter Ã¶verallt.
Energimassa i rumtid: ett i noll, existens i icke-existens, nÃ¥gonting i ingenting â€“ sÃ¥som definierats av E=mc
2
dÃ¤r c
2
stÃ¥r fÃ¶r ljusets hastighet (rum Ã¶ver tid dvs rumtid/noll/icke-existens) och E=m refererar till energimassa (existens, nÃ¥gonting, allt).
Distinktions-anti-distinktions-opposition: vi lever i en singulÃ¤r verklighet men vi ser multipla objekt.
En oÃ¤ndlig storleksskala.
De Ã¥vanstÃ¥ende tre idÃ©erna Ã¤r en existentiell teori (en teori som fÃ¶rklarar existensen av en reproduktiv form dvs evolutions bÃ¶rjan dvs vÃ¥r existens). Det Ã¤r modernt att anvÃ¤nda sig av tre likvÃ¤rdiga idÃ©er fÃ¶r att fÃ¶rklara ens existens â€“ alla tidigare existentiella teorier har antingen anvÃ¤nt en enda idÃ© (monoteism) eller en saga/myt (mÃ¥nga vardagliga (ej vetenskapliga/abstrakta) idÃ©er) fÃ¶r att fÃ¶rklara existens.
Den fÃ¶rutsÃ¤gande kvalitÃ©n som gÃ¶r denna existentiella teori till en vetenskaplig teori Ã¤r att den, baserat pÃ¥ en oÃ¤ndlig storleksskala av energimassarumtid och distinktions-anti-distinktions-opposition, fÃ¶rutsÃ¤ger att det i en oÃ¤ndlig storleksskala borde finnas en storlek dÃ¤r reproduktion (DNA) sker. Den existentiella teorin fÃ¶rutsÃ¤ger det fÃ¶rsta DNA:t, och frÃ¥n det fÃ¥r vi evolutionÃ¤r teori.
En annan fÃ¶rutsÃ¤gande kvalitÃ© Ã¤r att teorin fÃ¶rutsÃ¤ger att big bang borde varit
tÃ¤t
. A-priori begynnelsen av universum Ã¤r logiskt sett tomhet eftersom tomhet inte behÃ¶ver nÃ¥gon tidigare/fÃ¶religgande logiskt rÃ¤ttfÃ¤rdigande eftersom det ej existerar. I tom rumtid Ã¤r naturlagarna sanna, sÃ¥som naturlagarna som hanterar energimassa (sÃ¥som E=mc
2
), och dÃ¤rfÃ¶r bÃ¶rjar big bang oÃ¤ndligt tÃ¤t â€“ fÃ¶r att E=mc
2
Ã¤r lika sann samtidigt i de minsta storlekarna. De minsta tomma rymderna hade E=mc
2
som sann inom sig direkt nÃ¤r det fanns ingenting, vilket fÃ¶rutsÃ¤ger en tÃ¤t big bang. En region, inom event horizons gjorda av energimassa rusandes ivÃ¤g i >c (pga mÃ¶rk energi accelererandes kosmisk expansion) Ã¤r per definition â€ingentingâ€ i vilket E=mc
2
Ã¤r sann i de minsta utrymmena, vilket Ã¥stadkommer en big bang utom rÃ¤ckhÃ¥ll fÃ¶r de nÃ¤rmaste ( v = >c) energimassa. Ingenting (utom rÃ¤ckhÃ¥ll fÃ¶r nÃ¤rmaste energimassa fÃ¶r att den Ã¤r pÃ¥ vÃ¤g bortÃ¥t i >c) orsakas i centrumpunkten som har event horizons som grÃ¤ns lÃ¤ngst bort, vilket leder till en big bang (eftersom naturlagarna uppbringar energimassa i det tomma centrumet).
Det Ã¤r en stor historisk hÃ¤ndelse att det Ã¤ntligen finns ett ateistiskt argument i form av en universitetskurs: det Ã¤r en existentiell teori plus evolution som inte behÃ¶ver en personifierad gud fÃ¶r att fungera, utan dess pelare (oÃ¤ndlig storleksskala av energimassarumtid och distinktions-anti-distinktions-opposition) kan inte ha en personifierad gud tillagd till dem som en fjÃ¤rde pelare utan att teorin lÃ¥ter lÃ¶jlig. Det Ã¤r inte bara sÃ¥ att teorin inte behÃ¶ver en personifierad gud, utan att lÃ¤gga till en gud fÃ¶rstÃ¶r teorins minimalistiska rationellt kompletta skÃ¶nhet. Gudar fÃ¶rfular teorin. Teorins upptÃ¤ckt Ã¤r en stor historisk hÃ¤ndelse eftersom aldrig fÃ¶rr har en hel kurs (bÃ¶rjandes med sÃ¤ker sanning, gÃ¥endes genom den existentiella teorin och slutandes i evolution) lagts fram i ateismens intellektuella debatt, som ett argument mot en personifierad gud.
Anatomin i hjÃ¤rnan frÃ¥n att hÃ¶ra sÃ¤ker sanning (jag tÃ¤nker & jag finns) â€“ bÃ¶rjan av denna kurs â€“ skapar samma neuronala pathways / associationer mellan idÃ©er i varje person som hÃ¶r vet sÃ¤ker sanning. Det logiska steget till â€distinktionâ€ Ã¤r att notera, som meta-analys av den primÃ¤ra sÃ¤kra sanningen â€“ att man har mÃ¥nga idÃ©er (jag tÃ¤nker OCH jag finns) och att man kan ta den logiska vÃ¤gen till nÃ¤sta steg i kursen (distinktion finns). Att sedan motsÃ¤tta anti-distinktion med distinktion skapar den ofÃ¶rnimmbara â€“ â€mot resonâ€ (eftersom logik Ã¤r, i simpla mÃ¤nniskor, enbart visuell) â€“ slutsatsen att vi/distinktion inte kan se verkligheten/anti-distinktion. Distinktions-anti-distinktions-oppositionen Ã¤r svÃ¥rbegriplig fÃ¶r att den â€“ sÃ¥som formell logik eller matematik â€“ enbart anvÃ¤nder ord istÃ¤llet fÃ¶r bilder (den lingvistiska hjÃ¤rnhalvan istÃ¤llet fÃ¶r den visuella). Vi evolverade till att sÃ¤ga â€om jag kan se det sÃ¥ tror jag pÃ¥ detâ€ och det Ã¤r en god tumregel eftersom praktiska sekvenser hÃ¤ndelser kan verifieras som sanna eller osanna genom att visualisera dem. Men i denna filosofi: nej â€“ det mÃ¥ste vara lingvistiskt att vi fÃ¶rnekar oss sjÃ¤lva konceptet â€all verklighetâ€, vilket leder till slutsatsen att det finns mer till verkligheten Ã¤n nÃ¥gonting â€“ oavsett hur vagt universum definerat â€att representeraâ€ â€“ representerar. Detta tillÃ¤gger oÃ¤ndligt mÃ¥nga storlekar till vÃ¥r abstrakta stoorleksskala / storleks-tids-diagrammet; det gÃ¶r en rektangel (med storlek pÃ¥ y-axeln och tid pÃ¥ x-axeln) med oÃ¤ndlighetstecken i varje hÃ¶rn, som i sin tur blir en pelare i vÃ¥r personlig-gud-fÃ¶rnekande existentiella teori.
Att komma frÃ¥n sÃ¤ker sanningen genom enbart logiska steg (meta-analyser och motsÃ¤ttningsskapande av motsatser) till en existentiell teori som fÃ¶rutsÃ¤er evolutionen Ã¤r en stor historisk hÃ¤ndelse i ateismens historia.
I ett historiskt sammanhang Ã¤r anatomin (neurala anslutningar mellan idÃ©er och sekvenser logik) som skapas av denna kurs som ett paradigm-shifte in i en ny era av civilisation â€“ en era liknande den som finns pÃ¥ oÃ¤ndligt mÃ¥nga planeter vars vetenskap kommit lÃ¤ngre Ã¤n vÃ¥ra 4.5 miljarder Ã¥rs mittenpunkt i en vanlig vattenbÃ¤rande planets historia.
Evolution, genom att bÃ¶rja frÃ¥n â€en massa som samlar kringliggande massa till en liknande formâ€ kliver fram frÃ¥n den existentiella teorins oÃ¤ndliga storleksskala av energimassarumtid. Om vi antar att DNA Ã¤r replikationsmolekylen sÃ¥ kan vi ta steget till â€“ klivandes Ã¶ver hur cellvÃ¤ggar evolverade osv â€“ till att virus hijackar andras reproduktiva system. Detta â€“ i den universella inter-planetÃ¤ra rymdvarelsekulturen â€“ formuleras som, i bÃ¶cker av logik, som att de tre fÃ¶rsta reglerna uppkommer (liv/dÃ¶d, antalet avkomma har betydelse och â€det sker mutationer i varje generationsskifteâ€) och sedan att en fjÃ¤rde regel uppkommer (makt, med virus). Denna historia â€“ som i vÃ¥r kurs bÃ¶rjar frÃ¥n den fÃ¶rsta reproduktiva formen och slutar i att finslipa anatomin bakom makt i mÃ¤n â€“ Ã¤r visualiseringsbar som en grottmanna-historias narrativ likt dem vi evolverade till att se/hÃ¶ra. Vi kan proof-checka/validera historian genom att se den visuellt. Evolutions visuella natur Ã¤r i stark kontrast till den rent linguistiska/abstraka natur som den existentiella teorin har.
PÃ¥ tal om â€abstraktaâ€ beskrivningar dvs beskrivningar som gÃ¶r det vÃ¤ldigt klart fÃ¶r oss att vÃ¥r fÃ¶rstÃ¥else av universum bara Ã¤r en karta (en referens) och inte verkligheten i sig (tÃ¤nk pÃ¥ PlatoÂ´s och KantÂ´s grottmetafor och â€saken Ã¤r inte saken sjÃ¤lvâ€-filosofierâ€)â€¦ Storleksskalan av energimassarumtid, i storleken av kvantfysik har oss beskrivandes fotoner etc anvÃ¤ndandes bÃ¥de vÃ¥g-beskrivningar med fokus pÃ¥ lÃ¤ngder i rymd (dessa Ã¤r â€rumtids-beskrivningarâ€) OCH â€“ i vÃ¥r-partikel-dualitet â€“ energimassabeskrivningen dvs att energin i en foton Ã¤r dess fÃ¤rg. FÃ¤rg (sÃ¥som den uppfattas genom Ã¶gonen), vÃ¥g/rumtids-beskrivningen och partikel-energi/energimassa-beskrivningen Ã¤r alla legitimea beskrivningar av kvantfysiken. VÃ¥r fÃ¶rmÃ¥ga att beskriva vilken massa/vilket fenomen som helst med bÃ¥de energimassa- och rumtids-beskrivningar lÃ¶per genom hela storleksskalan. Du kan fÃ¶restÃ¤lla dig tvÃ¥ linjer â€“ en fÃ¶r energimassa och en fÃ¶r rumtid â€“ gÃ¥endes vertikalt genom alla bilder pÃ¥ storleks-axeln. TillÃ¤ggandes komplexitet pÃ¥ detta finns det tvÃ¥ linjer till â€“ tyngdlagen och elektromagnetism â€“ bÃ¥da gÃ¥endes lÃ¤ngs storleks-axeln, tyngdlagen har dess dualitet av energimassa- och rumtids-beskrivningar och elektromagnetism likasÃ¥ har desamma, dvs energimassa och rumtidsbeskrivningar. Tyngdlagen Ã¤r bÃ¥de Newtonisk â€massor dras till massorâ€ (energimassas fokus pÃ¥ massa) och Einsteinsk â€rumtids krÃ¶kningâ€ (rumtids fokus pÃ¥ rum) â€“ bÃ¥da beskrivningar Ã¤r korrekta.
Vi Ã¤r halvvÃ¤gs igenom en planets historia â€“ 4.5 miljarder Ã¥r har gÃ¥tt och 5 miljarder Ã¥terstÃ¥r. Teorin som du nu vet Ã¤r m.a.o. i kosmisk majoritet â€“ fler planeter har den Ã¤n har den inte (om det tar ungefÃ¤r hÃ¤lften av planetens historia att uppfinna den och om den kvarstÃ¥r under andra hÃ¤lften av planetens historia). De flesta andra planeter dvs majoriteten av rymdvarelser Ã¤r m.a.o. ideologiska anhÃ¤ngare av teorin. Sprid denna teori fÃ¶r att fÃ¥ bekrÃ¤ftelse av majoriteten trots att den bor ljusÃ¥r bort. Just nu lever 99.9% av jordens befolkning i eran av religioner â€“ sprid denna teori fÃ¶r att fÃ¥ slut pÃ¥ religiÃ¶sa krig samt terrorism sÃ¥som 9/11. VÃ¤rldsbilden (bilden/diagrammet som fÃ¶rklarar vÃ¤rlden) Ã¤r densamma i den kosmiska majoriteten.
Jag har jobbat i 10 Ã¥r fÃ¶r att Ã¥stadkomma teorin och som ensam om att kÃ¤nna till den Ã¤r det mitt ansvar att den sprids. Den framtida civilizationen i vilken alla har samma vÃ¤rldsbild hÃ¤nger dÃ¤rfÃ¶r pÃ¥ mig. Jag kÃ¤nner en unik mÃ¶jlighet att pÃ¥verka jordens framtid.

Can we
timetravel? We can proceed from era to era, just like dinosaurs preceded man and not vice versa â€“ its a universal sequence on any planet.
Heaven/karma instinctual but collides with main picture.
Water, primordial soup, proteins, dns strand. Single cell reproducing multiplying. Then 1 of these cells thought â€œill inject my own dna into some other cellâ€, hijack its reproductive system. Very beneficial. So first there were 3 rules: life n death, number of offspring matters and mutation in each generationshift, then with viruses came the 4th rule â€œpowerâ€ â€“ hijacking othersâ€™ reproductive system. Then theres an arms race between viruses and â€¦ â€œOur kind ofâ€ organism, so to mutate our immune system faster two genders arose. Then fights between males led to the dinosaurs. Then brains bonded into groups to fight individualists. Then capitalist power struggles within the group made the brain grow larger, weâ€™re good at planning and remembering things. Then we get to kingdoms. From the water puddle to the 21 st century. Those who proceed to the next era will live in a world where holy book-group bonds are weak and a universal courses group bond is the strongest, thus national wars or civilizational wars where identity is based on other than this science will be impossible. The planet has two future ways to go 60 years from now and one is better but needs some investment of time until everybody knows this course.
Theres a universal course/book thats on every advanced enough planet throughout the universe and at the regeneration of every universe. If you consider the entire corpus of human knowledge, youd find 3 rational starting points: certain truth, nothingness and that reality is one. Just like dinosaurs predate humans the first chapter with the 3 starting points predate the connecting of â€œi think n i exist, distinctionâ€ and â€œreality is one, antidistinction. Which leads to that there is more to reality than can be contemplated meaning that its infinite. Thats chaper 2: like multiplication and division are much higher levels of mathematics than adding and subtracting, chaper 2 is higher than the starting points in chapter 1.
â€”â€”â€”
If you want to be altruistic/selfless you can think about the millions of lives lost or living as refugees due to religious wars and group-loyalties based on ideology/religion. What if group-loyalty could be, for everyone, based on a single universal ideology? Then friendship ties, shared histories, well-mixing personalities and the like would form groups that donÂ´t have a religious mission/an ideological drive. When all ideologies are erased â€“ and religions too â€“ then simple biological mechanisms like common goals, shared interests and family ties bind us together â€“ and those kind of conglomerations are more likely to disintegrate than if there is a holy book or any ideological book as the binding principle between people. If ISIS would be educated then it would disintegrate and many civil wars break out among different families in Iraq/Syria â€“ but there would not be this major cleft between western&modern and holy&dogmatic.
If you want to be selfish like Ayn Rand: the upcoming world order / economy will be a meritocracy based on who advances or knows the most science. The ancient Chinese had a government where even the lowest peasant, if he passed a test in ConfusciousÂ´ teachings, could elevate himself higher in the society. Hierarchy is based on what is objectively to be admired; hierarchy is based on what infinitely many extraterrestrials in consensus have agreed upon be the criteria for how a humanÂ´s thoughts should be wired; hierarchy is based on the universeÂ´s disposition to reward those with the most accurate world-view or whom advance the pre-existing world-view and spread it to others â€“ the universe wants us choose to elevate in the hierarchy those whom appriciate the universe most fully, wholistically and most accurately. The old power-system based on money is upheld by banks and is based on present day humansÂ´ ties to the past. There will be an overlap between the old bank-based system for establishing VIP-status and the new economy which is a meritocracy based on science. If we want to be like planets ahead of us in the evolution of history, we ought to adapt the meritocracy-economy. After a few generations inherited money seems less legitimate than knowing or advancing science and by doing so wiring oneÂ´s cortex (flexible thinking part of the brain) as universally as possible (as much like the consensus among extraterrestrials is as possible).
There are three universal starting points for the universal course which will wire your brain universally. What I mean by â€œuniversalâ€ is that:
A) it is based on science meaning that it is retrievable from anywhere at any time; it is available universally unlike some time-specific language-specific location-specific holy-book-revalation.
B) universal means that it is how aliens/extraterrestrials sooner or later wire their brains. Sure: they can choose to live in a multi-worldviewical world but sooner or later the truth will conquer meaning that all various ideas among every tribe or nation will congregate (like a lens focuses many beams of light into one focal point) into a single set of ideas and prioritarizations â€“ a single world-view will emerge from the many. It is the identical world-view that all civilizing planets will congregate to/toward because science is universal. This congregating is as much of a universal step in evolution as that a planet with water will eventually have bacteria. Eventually everyone will know the course and the idea of this book. â€œWhat do you believe?â€ will no longer be a question because everyone has wired their cortexÂ´s ideas based on universal ideas/science.
â€”â€”â€“
Am I a muslim?
I have my size-time-diagram into which everything fits and this diagram being infinite gives an existential theory because:
â€“ sizes justify (are the cause of) one another, so thereÂ´s infinite justification.
â€“ time is infinite and our universe is observed to become nothingness in the future, and nothingness would be absurd if not for the fact that in the smallest spaces energymass is summoned because E=mc2 is a stable, constant law of nature.
â€“ there can only be separate distinct entities if distinction is counter-balanced and happens in non-distinction (a singular Reality). This point is much like the previous point of that only in nothingness can somethingness be summoned.
God, then, if we are to look for a meaning for the word, cannot be:
â€“ a specific object, size nor time within something infinitely larger
â€“ cannot, by definition, be apart from and â€œbeyondâ€ [that of which all is part] (Reality). Reality being an infinite size- and time-range of energymasspacetime is enough of an existential theory to explain us being here, the Big Bang, and the rest of the questions. God would, if claimed to be â€œbeyondâ€ the existential theory, be an unnecessary unproven assumption but more to the point: God would be â€œunrealâ€ if Reality is defined as we define it here. Such â€œbeyond Realityâ€-gods are unreal. WhatÂ´s more is that the phrase â€œAllah akbarâ€ (God is the biggest/greatest) wouldnÂ´t be true if Reality/[that of which all is part] is God plus Reality â€“ if [that of which all is part] has two major components, God and an energymasspacetime sizerange etc (the existential theory), then the sum of those two components is greater than God.
God, thus, obviously means Reallity by the definition of God being the greatest. God is then infinite. It makes sense to see people in awe over how much they can study, when they know thereÂ´s infinitely many fields of science which we do not have access to but which are logical and necessities for Reality to hold together. There being nothing absurd in an infinite size-range that resembles our known size-range (from quantum physics to the visible universe) is awesome and the highest you could possibly worship. This again proves that God is just a synonym for Reality/the existential theory.
Having studied all fields of science i.e. all sizes is the known sizerange, seeing how they all make up (justify) eachother (that itÂ´s just zooming in and zooming out), the wisdom that the sizerange is infinite (that there are infinitely many sizes making up one another) from the distinction (I think & I am logical path) and anti-distinction (that Reality is one) -thing, is the reason why we exist and God is not some size (sizes are not minds, except through evolution). Having studied all known sizes and knowing that the sizerange is infinite: it is an explanation to why weÂ´re here (akin to the Adam and Eve story or â€œGod created earth in 6 daysâ€ story) but it is not a revalation-giving thing â€“ the Quran wasnÂ´t written by God because God is not the kind of thing that writes/dictates stories. God being an infinite sizerange as thus our Creator is true, but the true way to get knowledge, rituals/pictoral representations and even guidance is through my work, not the work of the holy book-writers. The holy book writers might have said something true about God (just like I do in my work) â€“ but that is true of science textbooks moreso â€“ and they all said false things such as that God talks/gives revalations/authors holy books.
I can see the bronze-age marketing-teamÂ´s standpoint: people are more prone to follow dictates if theyÂ´re said to come from something/someone â€œhigher than humanâ€ i.e. a God or a ghost/spirit. Being invisible in as nonsense-a-way as some rituals are, is great for marketing. Everyone knows how humans thing â€“ theyÂ´re themselves human; we are only partly rational (a computer is rational) in what we think â€“ all our animal lusts bias or interrupt the thoughts that are as logical as they get, but theyÂ´re always going to be based against an evolutionary background just like the pitfall that my abstract diagram-including infinity-mentioning world-view is more like algebra than â€œwhat a world-view (context in which we are) should be thinking about that we lived for millions of years on the savannah, only needing to know (in oneÂ´s world-view) where the water-source is or whom stands under whom in the social hierarchy. WeÂ´ve mapped geographies, the use-based properties of objects/tools and personalities (and still do) for a gazillion years â€“ only with the advent of science SOME of us achieved higher i.e. used their evolved meager toolkit with all its biases to scetch out something like the theory of evolution in the 1800s. Looking at the evolution of [what we use our memory for]/how we map our surroundings/our world-view, before we mapped social relationships we mapped geographies. Before we mapped the functions of inventions (tools) our map only contained caveman tools (sharp stones and spears). The next step is to map oneÂ´s context as an infinite size-time-diagram (where size and time are really the same, but abstract thinking allows us to separate them into two distinct axises) or energymasspacetime (with itsÂ´ many laws of nature found in every school textbook in the world) and the distinction-antidistinction-
thing which feels so awkward/abstract that one wonders why one needs it as pillar 3 of the existential theory: the answer is: it wasnÂ´t invented (the words â€œI see a distinct objectâ€ or â€œwhy is there distinction?â€ werenÂ´t said in the same breath as â€œReality is oneâ€ or â€œenergymass and spacetime uniteâ€) until I did it in the 21st century). It might seem trivial to mention that separate entities exist in a singular Reality â€“ itÂ´s so obvious (thatÂ´s why no-one cared to make a big fuzz out of inventing it) but it makes the existential theory have three pillars (all of which can seem obvious) and not 4 â€“ thereÂ´s nothing more to add to the existential theory once youÂ´ve added the obvious â€œseparation in antidistinctionâ€-statement. I want to know how aliens (the infinitely many of them, steered by science toward an incommon path) think because its synonymous to finding a TRUE â€œkey to historyâ€ (Marx thought the key was equality, Hitler thought the key was racial superiority and a brutally competative relationship between races, Capitalism thinks itÂ´s freedom (less government), some might think they â€œkey to historyâ€ is to fund technological development). â€œHow aliens thinkâ€ is a shorthand way of saying â€œthe key to historyâ€ or â€œwhat will happen next/eventually and in hindsight seen as akin to the era of ancient grecoroman culture, the Industrial Revolution or the Digital revolution)â€. ItÂ´s what weÂ´re steered towards; itÂ´s the closest thing we get to divine guidance. ItÂ´s simply universal (drawn on science and practiced by infinitely many aliens) guidance/suggestions/
recommendations that we, as a species, can choose to promogate and thus â€œfollowâ€ or if weÂ´ll stick to multiculturalismÂ´s many -ismÂ´s like political quran-based islamism or christian-based â€œthe holy book gave me thisâ€-morality and codes of conduct. Some -ismÂ´s are dangerous (like quran-based politics and law) while some -ismÂ´s like christianity give too much credit to the -ism for simple human decency (in an age of extreme wealth globally). When my tummy is full IÂ´m a decent person â€“ I try to make money but IÂ´m not desparate after extreme wealth because I know that my caveman-brainÂ´s â€œneedâ€ for power (through status-symbols and freedom of space my environment to maximize the effectiveness of my hobby (writing)) wonÂ´t get satisfied no matter what external extravaganzas trigger my eyeballs, nor can people (socializing) make me much more satisfied than I am right now because all that is interesting and that there is to people is their brain â€“ and after a few weeks together thereÂ´ll be nothing I know nor any mental tool that I use that wonÂ´t, despite copyright, be in the hands of my friend: we wonÂ´t talk science (me teaching him/her) after all the science has been taught. I donÂ´t care to teach trivia so when I say â€œI teach SCIENCEâ€ I mean a finite thing: the existential theory plus something from each level of the known sizerange. Getting a P.hD from specializing on finding the structure of a rare protein only found in the feet of Amazonian forrest-mice is to put your eyes too close to the diagram; P.hDs for specializing/having a very narrow topic for oneÂ´s mind to engage in are for people who donÂ´t see the forest for the trees and care to rather look at one leaf of one tree instead of thinking about and seeing the forest as a whole. IÂ´m a forest person â€“ a leaf 10 cm from my eyes just bugs me. ThatÂ´s why there is a finite repertoire to what I call â€œscienceâ€ â€“ it takes a few days for me (my accomplishment/my work) to be fully understood and if repeated repetative. One only needs to know why/where one exists (the existential theory) once â€“ one canÂ´t forget it because we are made to remember the very context in which we live (here an evolutionary bias helps us: when someone explains â€œwhat the world isâ€ we remember it because â€œwhat the world wasâ€ in caveman days was the most useful thing the brain could do â€“ in fact we evolved such large brains because bigger brains remember better (can moreso map social relationships, successfull or unsuccesfull learning-experiences). We want to climb upwards in the hierarchy, find a mate, etc but all these wants and needs would be useless (theyÂ´d having nothing to work on) if it werenÂ´t for the map (of social relationships etc) that our brain is capable of remembering. We are inclined to remember existential theories because such knowledge about our place in the context was as useful as mapping whom is married to whom. This bias, by the way, is something holy book writers used to get people interested in their book. â€œGod created earth in 6 days (not 5)â€ is memorable because of our bias toward wanting to know about â€œcreation of the worldâ€ â€“ so the number â€œ6 daysâ€ is remembered too because it adds to the map that we then work on to seek power and other evolutionary benefits. ItÂ´s hard to make plans that have one reach evolutionary benefits if one does not know oneÂ´s environment/the external world. â€œ6 days for creating this place/worldâ€ adds to oneÂ´s map of the environment/place/external world. We have a bias for remembering it. Too bad the bronze-age holy books used this marketing trick (â€œhey, letÂ´s say something about their world (like the creation of it) because that would be something they remember!â€) to give pseudo- existential theories. The holy books made sales because not only do people want information about their context, people also want God to talk and interfere with day-to-day personal activites. Once you have a pseudo-explanation for how/why the world was created, youÂ´re free to add to that pseudo-explanation that â€œthe creator talksâ€. ItÂ´s impossible to add such a talking thing to my existential theory â€“ not only is it unnecessary (my theory works stand-alone) but it also contradicts basically every concept of my existential theory. The very definitions of energymasspacetime (meaning that God had nothingness as the canvas to paint on â€“ a nothingness that needs energymass and summons it because of the laws of nature inherent in that nothingness â€“ and chose to paint a beginning with as-dense-as-can-be (just like E=mc2 wouldÂ´ve created it because E=mc2 is true in the smallest spaces). Where was God when this happened? CouldnÂ´t have been energymass because energymass is only summoned once the universe becomes pure nothingness. If God is not energymass and energymass is existence â€“ then God doesnÂ´t exist / God is nothing. What doesnÂ´t exist or is nothing doesnÂ´t give revalations to men, doesnÂ´t care whom you sleep with, etc. Is God or GodÂ´s heaven a location in our size of infinite spacetime? In that case God is simply a far-away alien (which warrants questions about its evolution) but again â€“ it doesnÂ´t talk to us because of the distance and we wouldnÂ´t be too impressed even if an evolved God did talk to us (we are quite like it â€“ our science is the same, our world-view is the same). God is not a location in a size but is God a size? The sizerange is infinite (as proven by distinction not being able to see antidistinction) and thatÂ´d mean that thereÂ´s a creator to God (and that thing too has a creator, ad infinitum) IN THE SAME WAY as humans built cities or atoms make molecules. Again, if God is a size it warrantÂ´s the question: is God every location of that size or is God, like humans, in a location of that size? Whatever be the case, God still couldnÂ´t communicate with us. Since God fits neither in the context of energymasspacetime nor the context of the sizerange, a God-theory absolutely contradicts the true theory. What is said about God â€“ that God is the greatest â€“ makes only one â€œlocationâ€/notion in the existential theory correspond to a non-talking uncaring God: the theory itself (and more precisely Reality/[that of which all is part]) is the greatest. It certainly doesnÂ´t hear/talk nor give revalations because it comes as an infinite sizerange of energymasspacetime. When you tell this science, you can get to the point where you define Reality as â€œthat of which all is partâ€ and the greatest â€“ you can even get to antidistinction/the unrepresentability of Reality (fully, because we do represent some things) and people might still hope that a talking God can exist. But as soon as you mention the less abstract (the more abstract was that [that of which all is part cannot be observed]), the God-theory either surrenders or is in conflict with a/the existential theory which certainly is true (anyone can verify how the components of the theory fit together, make sense and explain everything). God as a synonym for Reality is boring â€“ why do we even have two words if we mean the same (scientific sizerange) thing.
If you assume that God is a synonym for Reality (which comes as an infinite sizescale, which in turn predicts a DNA-strand somewhere and voila: everything is explained), then I believe in your God. It doesnÂ´t appriciate my appriciation of it though, nor do rituals, following rules (made by men) etc please it. If I am to â€œshow my appriciation to itâ€ I do it by writing as I do right now â€“ thatÂ´s my worship of it: but IÂ´m under no illusion that this writing would please God by being logical (eventhough Reality itself is logical too â€“ so we have something incommon) â€“ me writing can be called worship but the only appriciating recipients of my writing are me and readers of my text. Whatever I write about Reality/God doesnÂ´t please God (because God is not a thing that listens, likes worship by others and other human needs) â€“ whatever worshippers do, I hope they do it for themselves and for other humans because no-one else is able to care or comprehend the worship. I would do the muslim prayer if I felt that that kind of discipline would benefit me (and a few times I did get a good feeling from going to the mosque and being among worshippers). ItÂ´s so easy to adapt to the customs of oneÂ´s peers (and especially oneÂ´s superiors, if one believes that there are those) that my attitude toward worship/ritual is â€œwhen in Rome, do like the romans (if you or others gain something out of it)â€. The world is complex â€“ I could have the same attitude toward the beliefs of islam: that IÂ´ll just say that something is through eventhough it obviously isnÂ´t because it contradicts, say, a talking holy book-writing God. Could I make myself believe that something talkative is God? The belief disintegrates and I get the foul feeling of that IÂ´ve used my valuable memory to note down a lie everytime I would think just one step/association further from the belief itself. I can believe (in anything) but analyzing it even the smallest amount will make me disbelieve it. But when youÂ´re in the mood of not analyzing â€“ like when one is having a panic attack on oneÂ´s death-bed â€“ IÂ´ll be (extremely) simplistic and do what some people seem to always do: â€œbelieve (in something that breaks down when analyzed)â€. What confuses me is that some people believe all the time â€“ they seem perfectly sane but they believe in a talking, scripture-giving God (that doesnÂ´t fit anywhere in the existential theory). Do they need comfort (from untruth) all the time? It seems like theyÂ´re trying to argue their position, though. A perplexing phenomenon at first glance but when you consider that theyÂ´re uneducated about my existential theory, any theory will do (even a talking God-theory). I am not hateful of it when I see it in other people â€“ I see it as humorous/ridicilous â€“ but when it binds people together (to form what in essence is an army) and thereÂ´s many of them (10 000 religions/â€armiesâ€) the worldÂ´s got a problem. Binding people together through their shared scripture and their belief that something impossible is true is bad because groups tend to be more violent than individualists â€“ especially if their holy text 1) seems to bind billions of people to their army (morale-strength amplification in a group is the root of violence), and 2) preaches violence/disrespect (many holy books are xenophobic and eager to create an â€œus vs. themâ€-social dynamic). If the holy book is taken seriously (if it canÂ´t be thrown in the trash) then we have bronze-age xenophobia (based on who likes the book and who doesnÂ´t) creeping into the modern day, and we also have artificial bonding/loyalty â€“ we basically get groups who are hostile (or more disrespectful) toward anyone who doesnÂ´t see the point (â€œthereÂ´s a talking Godâ€) theyÂ´re promoting. ItÂ´s such an easily fixable problem: if you read my work you simply cannot believe in a talking God â€“ my professional role is that you can give me ANY individual and I can â€œconvertâ€ him/her into not believing in a talking God. Whether this person will follow his or her groupÂ´s rituals or codes of conduct, though, is up to them â€“ itÂ´s sheer peer pressure.
The â€œus vs. themâ€ â€œwe are a big groupâ€ (and especially) â€œwe should convert the whole world so that they use their precious memory for knowing nonsense like we doâ€ are such great reasons for violence â€“ and of course itÂ´s fixable because what these people lack is education: only where there is no theory, can a pseudo-theory take root. Only where there is no argument/debate/science can â€œGod talksâ€ seem like legitimate truth. This means that much of the worldÂ´s violence is due to a lack of education (about the big questions i.e. what I talk about). Sure: some religions can be interpreted to say â€œkill the infidelsâ€ or some other explicit declaration of war â€“ but itÂ´s hard for a religion to survive if it constantly preaces fighting (it must have more clever tactics than that â€“ but it does tend to seek world-dominion). IÂ´m not so worried that someone reads the Quran and thinks â€œIÂ´ll help the [unbelieves in the QuranÂ´s talking God] to get to hell faster, because the Quran says that thatÂ´s where they belongâ€. I am worried about that the Quran (or any holy book) is the glue that binds people together. Religion is the last glue before we enter an era where obviously arbitrary things like nationalism or language makes strangers feel more familiar with eachother. Nation and language arenÂ´t taken that seriously â€“ nor should religion be, but it is. This binding-effect that holy books have is what makes ISIS / the taliban etc so hard to defeat â€“ they think, not only that they have an all-seeing revalation-giving God on their side, but they also have the exact same copy of a book that a billion people have. They feel strong (with their, seemingly to them, superior numbers). Obviously ISIS underestimated the ability of the Quran to draw in arab nations into the fight over Iraq & Syria â€“ the modern world simply leaned on the fact that ISIS are not muslims because they interpret the bronze-age ramble wrong. But ISIS / the taliban is still a factor â€“ the quran binds too many people together in certain areas of the world â€“ violence is caused, due to the binding-effect, the â€œmoral superiorityâ€-effect, the â€œpower in numbers and billions of people read the Quranâ€-effect etc (all these effects are there even if you skip the parts about the talking God who word for word said the Quran) make men as prone to violence as anything can make them: theyÂ´re a group with an â€œus vs. themâ€ dogma & feeling and they feel like they have power in numbers. Add to that the frustration over having to finance an own home before one can ejaculate. Those circumstances can make the group take up arms and â€œsend the infidels where they belongâ€. Following the commandments frustrates, the whole notion of â€œletÂ´s all prioritize this text highest (our favorite book) so that weÂ´re bound togetherâ€ and that the text itself can be interpreted as violent all are a breeding-ground for trouble â€“ and when youÂ´re in the trouble that the text creates, you are not in the state of mind to do the internal debate necessary to disprove a talking God and thus make your whole way of life become something that you either do as meaningless fun or donÂ´t do because no-one cares. But just as some people want to become professional soccer players and some atheists do zen-meditation, humans (by personal preference) want hobbies, to take up a discipline, to do something that adds, say, pride to their life. I donÂ´t personally care about soccer and I donÂ´t feel pride from doing any ritual, but I can definitely see that others take the muslim prayers like an athlete takes their sport. ItÂ´s possible to find out the objective truth about whether these prayers â€œplease God or notâ€ (by, like IÂ´ve done in this text, disproving all kinds of false Gods and making the real God more mundane and not a talker). Rituals donÂ´t please Reality/â€the energymasspacetime sizerangeâ€ because it is not a thing that gets pleased â€“ itÂ´s like trying to please a rock. You do the prayers because you enjoy the pride/hobby for its own sake â€“ like someone doing sports likes his/her sport. Pleasing a rock/God to get to a â€œheavenâ€ (which too doesnÂ´t fit into the true existential theory) is stupid unless itÂ´s akin to a hobby/sport where you do it for doing itÂ´s sake. Same thing with the â€œheaven hates hamâ€-thing â€“ when you know enough science (enough = what IÂ´ve written so far in this text) youÂ´ll realize that the whole ham-prohibition is man-made (from the bronze age) and linked to some pre-scientific nonsense from-the-horseÂ´s-mouth-
statement (canÂ´t say rationale because itÂ´s dogma). If you (and secondarily your peers) are dedicated to nonsense (whether it be sports, stamp-collecting, memorizing capitals or not eating pork), then do it if it does something good like prove to yourself (and others) that you have a strong discipline (even though your effort is misdirected toward nonsense). I can invent a ritual and do it every day, and maybe IÂ´d feel pride over that I can keep to a schedule of nonsense, but I would never claim the theory that there is a talking God, and by extention I wouldnÂ´t say that that ficticious talker prohibited ham. The mundane action must be differentiated from the logical argument. Ham-prohibitions and talking Gods are artifacts that belong in the past â€“ modern white A4-paper is too beautiful for someone to write something as erroneous as â€œthere is a talking Godâ€ on it. But as IÂ´m writing this, people are dying because religion binds them together (and frustrates them, and boosts their war-morale in many ways). My work can cause a civil war within ISIS â€“ a civil rift so permiating that only family ties, friendships and common goals (to get money, not to spread islam) can keep people together in groups. Once my existential theory is known there will still be crime and instability in Iraq, Syria and Afghanistan, but the evil deeds will only be committed by groups of 2-3 people â€“ not 20 000 of them. The binding effect of the Quran can most clearly be seen in that internet-propaganda made Quran-readers from the USA and Europe go fight in Syria â€“ everyone wants a group and itÂ´s totally human to assume that knowing the same book will be enough for a bond to be as strong as one wants it to be.
Right now â€œmy workâ€ is 9 proper texts and a few videos. They all talk about the same thing (which can be formulated as: IÂ´ll say as much as I can about things IÂ´ve never heard anyone else say (and IÂ´ve seen the best professors in the world teaching truths)). To cause a rift in the taliban/ISIS and stop the war by making group-bonding (around a holy book) problematic/impossible, my whole â€œworkâ€ doesnÂ´t need to be dropped as propaganda books on top of ISIS and the taliban. ItÂ´s enough that the news headlines say that â€œa correct all-explaining existential theory has been found â€“ religions in crysisâ€ or that enough people know my theory so that a multitude of youtube videos are made where, in a sentence or two, the presenter goes off-topic and mentions why we exist / something from my theory. Having understood it once makes it impossible to forget â€“ having understood it once makes group-bonding over religion (which fuels ISIS/the taliban/etc) impossible. If the world could just take 20 minutes of itsÂ´ time to spend on explaining/teaching/arguing my work/theory, then the war on terror would be over â€“ otherwise it will persist as long as people have no actual, logical theory about their existence and thus believe in bronze-age marketing tricks.

The theory of evolution begins with the first reproducing shape. It was a shape that assembled surrounding mass into a similar shape. The existential theory predicts the existence of infinitely many such shapes. What inevitable becomes true when you have reproduction is that some die and some survive (life and death), that the number of offspring that shape make matters and that there is mutations over time. This is true about the shapeÂ´s offspring: some will die and some will survive, the number of offspring they make matters and the offspring can be different from the original shape. These three rules / laws of nature were inactive before the first reproduction occurred. The next main event was that one of these shapes found that if it injected its DNA into other shapesÂ´ reproductive mechanism, it exploited principle number two: that the number of offspring matters. It was the first virus: it hijacked othersÂ´ reproduction. The rule / law of nature that came into play with this event was that â€œpowerâ€ matters: hijacking othersÂ´ reproductive mechanism gives evolutionary benefits. Now weÂ´ve listed the four main rules that govern evolutionary theory: first came the three first, and then came the forth: power. The next main event â€“ to guard against viruses taking over all life / reproductive mechanisms â€“ was that an immune system evolved to protect against virusÂ´ hijack attempts. This required multicellularism. Just like immune systems prompt/require multicellularism, immune systems prompt/require multigenderedism: to win in the arms race against quickly mutating viruses two genders arose to amplify the mutations to the immune system. Mixing genes from two genders creates a more mutated immune system, which can keep ahead in the arms race against quickly-mutating viruses â€œtryingâ€ to mutate to bypass any immune system. The next main event is that one of these multicellular organisms â€“ a fish or worm â€“ of the male gender mutated to be agressive and defeat other males in battle. He wouldÂ´ve gotten access to many more females than his non-agressive counter-parts. This too can be called â€œpowerâ€ because the agressive male hijacks other maleÂ´s access to females by killing the males. This prompts the dinosaurs because larger muscle mass and shaper weaponry is better at killing off competitors. Amongst the dinosaurs there was the mother-offspring bond, placed there by evolution for the evolutionary benefits a mother gets from seeing an offspring survive to adulthood. This bond mutated to involve flock-members because a group working together out-competes any individualists when fighting over anything. The next main event was that someone mapped the flock, in his brain, as a hierarchy (up-down-axis) with the longing to dominate peers.

Dude, evolution has me try to maximize evolutionary benefits using my plans; im always thinking at full speed and pain drives that thinking. And i know for certain that all this pain is meaningless. Its a suicide recipe but what prevents me from suicide is the natural strength that stems from being the pinnacle of beasts who all have survived for generations.

New book 2017
Chapter 1:
What problem does this solve?
This solves a problem that becomes most visible 60 years from now when sea-levels rise, the economy goes into permanent decline and oil ends. ThatÂ´s when humans start to fight (and belong in world-view-based groups to do so). While the economy is still rising the clashes are few and far between â€“ Afghanistan, Syria, ISISÂ´ world-wide terror attacks (mainly muslim world-views clashing with tolerant world-views). When the economy starts declining thereÂ´ll naturally be more friction between groups, and groups are made up of world-views (people identify as in a group based on world-view).
Advancing the scientific world-view to the level where it explains our origin and thus invades religious intellectual turf, solves the problem of world-views colliding as war.
Chapter 2:
Certain truth â€“ I think & I am
You have a composite certain truth consisting of two certain truths: you can claim as certain that you think (because if you were being fooled: being fooled is thinking) and that you exist (because being fooled requires the one who is fooled to be there). I think and I exist is one statement but two truths. You can certainly claim to have â€œdistinctionâ€ because youÂ´re dealing with multiple separate distinct entities (such as â€œIâ€ and â€œthoughtâ€). One could put it, while seeing the certain truths â€œI thinkâ€ and â€œI existâ€, that the space between the two notions (thinker and thought) is the hallmark of distinction. The distance separating thinker from thought we can recognize as necessary for â€œdistinctionâ€ to be concluded as a certain truth arising, in a next logical step, from the original primary certain truth.
Everyone agrees they they themselves exist, because if one would get fooled in everyone one can be fooled in then one would exist there anyway and be fooled. So one knows that one exists. Then one also knows that one thinks because â€œto get fooledâ€ is a thought-process. Thus we have two things: I think and I exist. And the distinction between them: and on the flipside of the paper we have the opposite of that: anti-distinction, and this can also be called â€œthat of which all is partâ€/Reality. And since we are in the distinction-side of the paper when we see something; when we see something there is distinction between us and that thing. Thus we cannot represent or see that which is on the other side of the paper i.e. that of which all is part / Reality. Nothing can represent â€“ because it is distinct â€“ Reality. So whatever which is distinct cannotâ€¦ whatever that is observed or represented is distinct and therefore is notâ€¦ therefore does not represent Reality / â€œthat of which all is partâ€. So we have distinction and anti-distinction as opposing poles.
You have a certain truth which everyone in the whole world agrees upon. You think and you exist since if you were being fooled by an almighty demon youÂ´d still both think and exist. Then there are two things i.e. distinction. All is part of a single reality which is anti-distinction, there are no separate parts: reality is one. If we put distinction on the left side of the paper and anti-distinction on the right side then (we) distinction cannot see that of which all is part because â€œto seeâ€ is â€œto representâ€ and then one uses something to refer to reality. There is nothing outside reality which can refer to reality but instead reality is defined as â€œthat of which all is partâ€ and then there is nothing that can refer to all of reality. The opposition between the two sides of the paper (distinction & anti-distinction) makes reality as â€œthat of which all is partâ€-anti-distinction non-representable because representation always involves distinction. What we see, for example, is just parts of reality. The hypotheses can be infinitely much so there is infinitely much to reality. Sizes and times, that is. In the existential theory (â€œwhy we existâ€) there, thus, is an infinite size-range with time, energymass in spacetime (everything and nothing intertwined like in the E=mc2 equation â€“ energy equals mass times, well â€“ spacetime; multiplication is what unites energymass with spacetime). Then we have distinction and anti-distinction: separate things but all is part of a single reality. The existential theory with its three pillars, that is an infinite sizerange, energymasspacetime and distinction-anti-distinction-opposition, predicts that there should be a tiny piece of DNA which copies itself.
Then thereÂ´s another kind of revelation that got respect. Descartes who lived in the 1600s got respect, fame and was invited to live with the Queen of Sweden because he had gotten an idea which certainly told us something true. Revelations can either be con menÂ´s statements like they were from ape-man and forward, or they can actually claim something which is verifyably true. Descartes, propably having his mind overcrowded by the masses of revelations that had accumulated to his time, asked: â€œwhat would be true if all my statements were false?â€. What would remain if I tossed all my knowledge and ideas into the trash? Are we stuck with countless unverifyable statements, some contradicting eachother, not knowing which ones are true and which ones are not? Obviously not since statements about architecture are obviously true since they build houses, while contradictory statements do not. So Descartes dared to throw all his knowledge in the trash to see what remained. He found certain truth: that he exists â€“ because even if he was wrong or was being fooled in everything he thought to be true, thereÂ´d still be a â€œheâ€ there. He certainly exists no matter what. Same thing goes for thoughts: being wrong or being fooled is a thinking-process so even if he was wrong or was being fooled in everything he thought, thereÂ´d still be thought.
Socrates: So he figured out that he thinks and he exists.
God: These are not one statement â€“ they are two.
Socrates: What does that mean?
God: IÂ´ll tell you later â€“ just agree with me that there is distinction between thinker and thought â€“ that the statements are two. ItÂ´s building on certain truth, and itÂ´s possible to build a wholeâ€¦ whatever it is that â€œsaves the worldâ€ from the coming economic decline by having everyone build on certain truth until the God-debate is settled. Remembering â€œdistinctionâ€ (between thinker and thought) will prevent the horror-scenario of large-scale future wars between people group-bound by religions, and instead â€“ since everyone built a whole world-view on certain truth â€“ have a more stable decline in the future. â€œDistinctionâ€ i.e. remembering that there are two certain truths (thinker and thought) is a step on the way toward a plan that will save humanity from destroying itself as much as it would if we didnÂ´t build our world-views on certain truth.
Plato: So after an era of â€œrevelationâ€-revelations invented by anyone for whatever purpose, coming from DarwinÂ´s ape-manÂ´s revelations, Descartes, in the 1600s, invented a revelation â€“ certain truth: I think and I exist â€“ which got him invited to the Queen of Sweden for the rest of his life. People have always liked revelations and even verifyable truth-claims like DescartesÂ´ get respect.
God: I have set it as true that each one of you humans can verify in your own mindÂ´s eye that you do certainly exist and that there certainly is thought â€“ and thus there is distinction.
Darwin: Distinction is an abstract word. That two objects are separate/different from one another is one of those notions and ape-man never made into language â€“ there was never the evolutionary need to talk about â€œdistinctionâ€. Yes: one could say that one banana is different from another (and one wants the bigger one), but to have Distinction exist stand-alone as a distinct notion is abstract thinking and we are not evolved to do that. For millions of years the caveman word for â€œdistinctionâ€ was only used in a sentance â€“ not stand-alone as in â€œdistinction certainly exists because thinker and thought are both certain truthsâ€.
Chapter 3:
Distinction-antidistinction-opposition
The first proof for that the size-time-diagram is infinite is distinctionÂ´s (our) inability to see/represent anti-distinction.
Chapter 4:
Maximum size?
The second prooof for that the size-time-diagram is infinite is that if we imagine a partless anti-distinction then it has no distinction as in a â€œmaximumâ€ or â€œminimumâ€ size, i.e. the size-range is infinite.

Everyone agrees on that reality is one. Because itÂ´s one nothing can represent it, because the representer too should be part of reality. That means that there is a size-time-diagram which is infinite. And thatÂ´s why we exist. Everyone agrees on this eventhough we are distinct unique individuals. We have this world-view incommon, with extraterrestrials too.

The ultimate argument against God i.e. a new existential theory
You know for certain that you think and that you exist because in the event that you were being fooled (or threw all your knowledge in the trash) you would "think" because being fooled is a thinking-process and you would exist because "being fooled" implies that there is someone there who is being fooled
There is distinction between thinker and thought. There are separate entities. "Distinction" is one logical step from certain truth.
All is part of a single reality - "all as one" is anti-distinction (the opposite of distinction).
Can thinker or thought see anti-distinction? Can distinction represent anti-distinction? The opposites cannot catch one another.
Is there thus distinction in the form of a maximum or minimum size (or time) in anti-distinction? No, therefore size and time are infinite.
Another proof for that the size-range is infinite is that the universe defined "represents" infinitely vaguely, meaning that this
text
- in the eyes of God - is attempting to represent "that of which all is part"/reality as one, but fails because representation is distinction and reality is anti-distinction.
At every size you see energymass (existence) and spacetime (non-existence) as intertwined, as in E=mc
2
(where c
2
is spacetime). Because E=mc
2
is true in every size (including the smallest ones) the Big Bang gets summoned as dense when there is nothingness. Telescope observations show that nothingness is coming in the future again.
An infinite size-range of energymasspacetime and distinction-anti-distinction explains our existence better than God.
A size-time diagram with evolution originating in the middle of the known size-range.
You know for certain that you think and that you exist because even if an almighty demon was fooling you in everything you can possibly be fooled in, the fooling itself is a thought-process and therefore you know that thought exists (you think), and for you to be fooled you have to exist and therefore you know "I exist". Being fooled is thinking and a thinker is necessary for there to be someone to be fooled. So you know: no matter what, you think and you exist. Those are two things, right? TheyÂ´re both part of the same brain and the thought-process can become the analytical toolkit/thinker, but still we recognize that there are distinct entities - there is distinction. This can also be called separation. What is distinctionÂ´s opposite, anti-distinction? ItÂ´s one reality; that of which all is part; itÂ´s one and realityÂ´s definition in the dictionary is that all is part of it. If we write distinction (thinker and thought) on the left side of the paper and anti-distinction (reality; that of which all is part; one) on the right side of the paper - can the left side see the right side? No, because of opposition between distinction and anti-distinction. Because of there always being an observer (a thinker) and thus distinction in every observation and thus anti-distinction canÂ´t be represented/seen.
The brain evolved to deal with natural occurances - there was never an event in history where something invisible was to be contemplated and dealt with. Thus we seem to assume that the thought-process went wrong when we say that distinction/us canÂ´t see anti-distinction/reality. But the thought-process didnÂ´t go wrong: all that it means is that there is more to reality than can be represented. Regardless of how vaguely "represents" is defined, say a coffee cup - regardless of brains being involved - is assumed to try to represent that of which all is part, then anti-dinstinction - distinction - opposition (the opposition between distinction and itÂ´s opposite) makes the representation incorrect. We can ask if there in an anti-distinct "thing" is a maximum size and thus distinction? No. Likewise, another proof for that the size-range is infinite is that we do sense something (our everyday world) and can make hypotheses ad infinitum, and yet nothing represent
s ALL OF reality. Reality i.e. s
ize-time thus is infinite.
The infinite size-range is one pillar in the existential theory. Another pillar is energymass and spacetime being opposites but intertwined as in E=mc
2
(where c
2
refers to a speed which is space over time: spacetime). Multiplication joins energymass together with spacetime; nothing together with something/everything; existence together with non-existence. Why is there existence the shape of my body? Without going into the historical answer, one can explain it by saying that the body is something in (intertwined with) nothing, of a size in an infinite size-range (where the relationship between any two sizes (or objects of two sizes) i
s that they make sense of i.e. j
ustify one another). Then there too, as a third pillar, is distinction-an
ti-distinction-opposition i.e. w
e live in a single (not plural) reality but we see distinct/separate entities such as thinker and thought.
Speaking of spacetime, spacetime is the logical starting point for the time-based existential theory.
Nothingness (empty space) needs n
o prior justification nor reason to exist, because it doesnÂ´t exist. In it, however
, laws of nature are true i.e. i
t is not irrational / anti-logical, and among the many laws of nature there are those, including E=mc
2
, which mention energymass.
Could energymass be "mentioned" without it existing? If yes, it would be absurd / anti-logical. Why would reality mention things that never exist? But since laws of nature are firm and because of our rule "what is mentioned must exist or must be summoned" we get, wherever (in the smallest spaces) that E=mc
2
is mentioned, existence and thus dense existence: a big bang. The fact that galaxies are speeding away acceleratingly from one another leads to nothingness in the future, and with the middleman "laws of nature" again energymass is summoned as dense as can be. No time-delay between nothingness - laws of nature - energymass but as soon as a bordered (by event horizons which are determined by the finite speed of light) region becomes nothingness, a big bang occurs and eventually becomes nothingness bordered by event horizons again. This is the time-wise description of why energymass (which exists intertwined with spacetime as in E=mc
2
) starts dense and becomes nothingness, and repeats.
All of the above is a rival theory to "God created earth in 6 days and rested on the 7th". It is unintuitive because it deals with things we didnÂ´t have to deal with in evolution: invisible energymasspacetime/reality/anti-distinction as a part of reasoning. It also has a multi-reason cause for our existence: a time-wise rationale involving the beginning and end of the big bang combined with a 3-pillar existential theory which justifies size and energymass. It is abstract/scientific but canÂ´t be reduced into simpler terms. ItÂ´s the lowest common denominator that everyone can believe in (regardless of religion).
How many is reality? One. How many is Allah? One. Can anything completely represent reality? No. Can anything completely represent Allah? No. Is reality the greatest (if all is part of it)? Yes. Is â€œAllah akbarâ€? Yes. Reality and Allah have these three things incommon â€“ so maybe reality is synonymous with Allah?
How vaguely has reality defined â€to representâ€?
Infinitely vaguely â€“ anything can represent anything.
Is the representation/representer reality or Allah?
No.
Can anything represent that of which all is part?
No.
Then the size-time-diagram is infinite i.e. nothing represents reality. How many is it? How many is Allah? 1.
Did it sayâ€¦, or did it wri
te a book?
This disproves Allah writing the Quran.
Again: how much of reality can be represented by, say, a painting? The whole of it?
No, the whole of reality cannot be represented. Just like Allah canÂ´t be captured in a picture/word.
We can have hypotheses â€“ how many hypotheses can we have?
If reality is sizes & times, energymass and spacetime then the square-shaped size-time-diagram with energymasspacetime in each coordinate is the universal way to represent all there is to represent.
Does it write books? No, it is not of such authorship-kind nature.
â€œGod said to Muhammed word by wordâ€¦â€ is thus a false or at most metaphorical statement.
â€œYou have to do rituals in order not to go to hell, and in heaven you get 72 virginsâ€ is by the same logic also a false claim.
There are three alternatives as the foundation for this logic â€“ can you think of a 4
th
one?
1: Reality is a synonym for Allah
2: or Allah doesnÂ´t exist
3: or there are 72 virgins (not an alternative because reality is not of the nature, because it is size-time-energymasspacetime, to write books).
In addition to the square size-time diagram with infinity symbols in each of itÂ´s corners, and the evolutionary triangle which designates that life becomes more complex as time goes on
(the triangle originates at the central size of the known size-range), there is the following brain diagram:
You have a composite certain truth consisting of two certain truths: you can claim as certain that you think (because if you were being fooled: being fooled is thinking) and that you exist (because being fooled requires the one who is fooled to be there). I think and I exist is one statement but two truths. You can certainly claim to have â€œdistinctionâ€ because youÂ´re dealing
with multiple separate distinct entities (such as â€œIâ€ and â€œthoughtâ€). One could put it, while seeing the certain truths â€œI thinkâ€ and â€œI existâ€, that the space between the two notions (thinker and thought) is the hallmark of distinction. The distance separating thinker from thought we can recognize as necessary for â€œdistinctionâ€ to be concluded as a certain truth arising, in a next logical step, from the original primary certain truth.
Are all distinct entities part of a single reality if â€œrealityâ€ is defined as â€œthat of which all is partâ€? In other words: if we draw distinction on the left side of a paper and anti-distinction (distinctionÂ´s opposite: a singular reality â€“ that of which all is part. Zooming out summarizing maximally) on the right side of the paper, then can distinction represent the right side of the paper i.e. anti-distinction? How could some distinct entities depict the very opposite of what representation/distinction is? Any depiction/representation of anti-distinction/reality has at least three entities: thinker, space between thinker and thought, and thought. Separation/distinction is inherent in representation, thus anti-distinction is unrepresentable.
How vaguely has the universe/God defined what a representation is i.e. when a representation occurs? Our brains use neurons to represent, but what if â€“ instead of neurons (regardless of brains) â€“ the universe wills that any random object can be said to, as neurons do, represent reality? The universe has defined â€œrepresentationâ€ infinitely vaguely i.e. disregarding brains, any random object spontaneously is the symbol standing for all of reality â€“ because the universe defines â€œrepresentsâ€ infinitely vaguely. Despite the infinitely vague definition of what represents what, distinction-anti-distinction-opposition (the line separating the left side of the paper from the right side; the countering of distinction with anti-distinction) means that reality is not representable. If reality is anti-distinction then no distinction (representation is inherently distinction) can even, despite an infinitely vague definition of â€œrepresentsâ€, capture reality.
In
representations we can count at least three things and what weÂ´re trying to capture is one thing with nothing outside it. The fact that representations contain distinction makes capturing reality (all is one) impossible.
We can have infinitely many or infinitely large/substancefull representations/hypotheses â€“ such as an infinite size-time-diagram â€“ and though abstractly accurately pointing to reality, the universeÂ´s rule that nothing represents reality despite infinitely vaguely allowed representations of infinitely much, makes reality unrepresentable. This can only mean one thing: reality â€“ which we know as sizes and times (a size-time-diagram) â€“ is infinite. ThereÂ´s infinitely large and infinitely small with infinitely much past and infinitely much future. This square-shaped size-time-diagram i.e. our everyday experience of size-time has infinities all-over the place.
Energymass in spacetime: one in zero, existence in non-existence, something in nothing â€“ as defined by E=mc
2
where c
2
stands for speed (distance over time i.e. spacetime/zero/non-existence) and E=m referring to energymass (existence, something, all).
Distinction-anti-distinction-opposition: we live in a singular reality but we see multiple objects.
An infinite size-range.
The above three ideas are an existential theory (a theory which explains the existence of a reproducing shape and thus the dawn of evolution and thus our existence). It is modern to utilize three equal ideas to explain oneÂ´s existence â€“ all previous existential theories used either a single idea (monotheism) or a saga (multiple mundane (not very scientific/abstract) ideas) to explain existence.
The predictive quality that makes this existential theory a scientific theory is that it, basing it off an infinite size-range of energymasspacetime and distinction-anti-distinction-opposition, predicts that in an infinite size-range there ought to be a size where reproduction occurs. The existential theory predicts the first DNA, and from there we get to the evolutionary theory.
Another predictive quality is that the theory predicts a
dense
Big Bang. The a priori beginning of the universe logically is emptiness because emptiness doesnÂ´t need any prior logical justification for its existence because it doesnÂ´t exist. In emptiness laws of nature are true, such as the laws pointing toward and handleing energymass (like E=mc
2
), and thus the Big Bang begins infinitely dense because E=mc
2
is equally true simultaneously in the smallest of spaces. Tiny empty spaces having E=mc
2
be true in them simultaneously and directly as there was nothingness predicts a dense Big Bang. A region, contained within event horizons made out of energymasses speeding away at >c (due to dark energy causing accelerating cosmic expansion), is by definition â€œnothingâ€ in which E=mc
2
being true in the tiniest spaces summons a dense big bang out of reach of the closest (v = >c) energymass. Nothingness (out of reach for the closest energymasses because they are speeding away at >c) is summoned in the central point with event horizons as the furthest away border, causing Big Bang (due to laws of nature summoning energymass in the empty center).
The theory of evolution begins with the first reproducing shape. It was a shape that assembled surrounding mass into a similar shape. The existential theory predicts the existence of infinitely many such shapes. What inevitable becomes true when you have reproduction is that some die and some survive (life and death), that the number of offspring that shape make matters and that there is mutations over time. This is true about the shapeÂ´s offspring: some will die and some will survive, the number of offspring they make matters and the offspring can be different from the original shape. These three rules / laws of nature were inactive before the first reproduction occurred. The next main event was that one of these shapes found that if it injected its DNA into other shapesÂ´ reproductive mechanism, it exploited principle number two: that the number of offspring matters. It was the first virus: it hijacked othersÂ´ reproduction. The rule / law of nature that came into play with this event was that "power" matters: hijacking othersÂ´ reproductive mechanism gives evolutionary benefits. Now weÂ´ve listed the four main rules that govern evolutionary theory: first came the three first, and then came the forth: power. The next main event - to guard against viruses taking over all life / reproductive mechanisms - was that an immune system evolved to protect against virusÂ´ hijack attempts. This required multicellularism. Just like immune systems prompt/require multicellularism, immune systems prompt/require multigenderedism: to win in the arms race against quickly mutating viruses two genders arose to amplify the mutations to the immune system. Mixing genes from two genders creates a more mutated immune system, which can keep ahead in the arms race against quickly-mutating viruses "trying" to mutate to bypass any immune system. The next main event is that one of these multicellular organisms - a fish or worm - of the male gender mutated to be ag
g
ressive and defeat other males in battle. He wouldÂ´ve gotten access to many more females than his non-ag
g
ressive counter-parts. This too can be called "power" because the ag
g
ressive male hijacks other maleÂ´s access to females by killing the males. This prompts the dinosaurs because larger muscle mass and shaper weaponry is better at killing off competitors. Amongst the dinosaurs there was the mother-offspring bond, placed there by evolution for the evolutionary benefits a mother gets from seeing an offspring survive to adulthood. This bond mutated to involve flock-members because a group working together out-competes any individualists when fighting over anything. The next main event was that someone mapped the flock, in his brain, as a hierarchy (up-down-axis) with the longing to
be the top of the hierarchy. This capitalist striving for
the top made brains grew larger â€“ larger memory-banks, more accurate predictions and faster planning are all advantages coming
from a larger cortex.
Power lead men to accumulate resources â€“ the very resources females needed for their children. Females care most about their children because they pass on their genes, so in finding a male they aim for loyalty plus status/power/placement in the hierarchy. Females think a lot about how others â€“ especially suitors â€“ perceive them and therefore males evolved the subconscious mechanism, to keep womenâ€™sÂ´ attention, to push-pull i.e. to, in one coherent fluent conversation, both say negative feedback about the woman and positive feedback.
It is a major historical event that there finally is an atheistic argument that is sh
aped like a university course: i
t is an existential theory plus evolution which not only doesnÂ´t need a personified god to function, but the pillars (infinite sizerange of energymasspacetime and distinction-anti-distinction-opposition) canÂ´t have a personified god added to them as a 4th pillar without the theory sounding ridicilous. Not only does the theory not need a personified god but adding a god destroys the minimalistic rationally complete beauty of the theory. Gods uglify the theory. The dawn of the theory is a major historical event because never before has an entire course (beginning with certain truth, going through the existential theory and ending in evolution) been laid out in the intellectual debate of atheism, as an argument against a personified god.
The anatomy in the brain from hearing certain truth (I think & I am) - the beginning of the course - creates the same neuronal pathways / associations between ideas in every single person who knows certain truth. The logical step to "distinction" is noting, as a meta-analysis of the primary certain truth, that one has many ideas (I think AND I am) and that one can take logical pathways to the next step in the course (distinction exists). Then juxtaposing anti-distinction with distinction creates the unseeable - "defying reason" (because reason is, in simple people, only visual) - conclusion that we/distinction cannot see reality/anti-distinction. The distinction-anti-distinction-opposition is hard to grasp because it - like formal logic or math - uses words instead of pictures (the linguistic brainhalf rather than the visual one). We evolved to be like "if I see it I believe it" and that was a good heuristic (rule of thumb) because practical sequences of events can be verified as true or untrue by visualizing them. But in this philosophy: no - it has to be linguistic that we deny ourselves the concept "all of reality", leading to the conclusion that there is more to reality than anything - however vaguely the universe has defined "represent" - can represent. This adds infinitely many sizes to our abstract size-range / size-time-diagram; it makes a square (with size on the y-axis and time on the x-axis) with infinity symbols in each corner, which in turn becomes a pillar in our personified-god-denying existential theory.
To come from certain truth, through mere logical steps (meta-analyses and juxtaposition of opposites), to an existential theory which predicts evolution is a major historical event in the history of atheism.
In a historical context the anatomy (neural connections between ideas and sequences of logic) created by this course is like a paradigm-shift into a new era of earth society - an era similar to
that existent on infinitely many other planets who have come further than our midway-mark in a regular water-bearing planetÂ´s history.
Evolution, by beginning with "a mass that can assemble surrounding mass into a similar shape" steps forth from the existential theoryÂ´s infinite size-range of energymasspacetime. Assuming DNA is the replication-molecule, we can step - skipping over how cell walls evolved etc - to the fact that viruses mutate to hijack othersÂ´ reproductive system. This - in this universal inter-planetary extraterrestrial culture - is formulated, in books of logic, as first three rules arising (life/death, number of offspring matters and "there is mutation in each generation-shift") and then a forth rule arising (power, with viruses). This story - which in our course begins from a first reproducing shape and ends with finessing the anatomy of power in men - is visualizable like the caveman story-telling narratives we evolved to hear/see. We can proof-check its validity/possibility by following the narrative visually. The visual nature of evolution is in stark contrast to the purely linguistic/abstract nature of the existential theory.
Speaking o
f "abstract" descriptions i.e. d
escriptions that make it very clear to us that our understanding of the universe is a mere map (a reference) and not reality itself (mind you of PlatoÂ´s or KantÂ´s cave-metaphor and "the thing is not the thing itself" -philosophies)... The size-range of energymasspacetime,
at the size of quantum physics
has us describe photons etc using both the wave-description which focu
s
es on lengths of space (this is the "spacetime description") AND - in wave-particle duality - the energymass description that the energy of a photon is its color. Color (as perceived through the eyes), wave/spacetime-description and particle-energy/energymass-description all are valid descriptors of quantum particles. This ability of ours to describe any mass/phenomenon using both energymass- and spacetime-descriptions runs throughout the entire size-range. You can imagine two lines - one representing energymass and the other representing spacetime - running vertically through the pictures on the size-axis. Adding complexity to this, there is likewise two lines - gravity and electromagnetism - both running through the size-axis, gravity having itÂ´s duality of energymass and spacetime descriptions and electromagnetism too having both, in every level of the size-range, energymass and spacetime descriptions. Gravity is both Newtonian "masses pulling toward masses" (energymassÂ´ focus on mass) and Einsteinian "curvature of spacetime" (spacetimeÂ´s focus on space) - both descriptors are accurate.
From having read this book, the following should now be understandable:
Certain truth leads to the conclusion â€œdistinctionâ€, and simultaneously warrants an anti-distinction defined as â€œthat of which all is partâ€. The opposition between distinction and anti-distinction â€“ despite â€œrepresentationâ€ being ubiquitous (infinitely vaguely defined) â€“ together with the â€œmax size?â€-question asked in anti-distinction â€“ supports the fact that reality i.e. size-time is infinite. This then becomes our pillar in our existential theory that moves God away from a creator role. The two other pillars are energimasspacetime (found in E=mc
2
) and the opposition that we live in a singular reality yet see multiple things. From the middle of the known size-range (which itself is part of the infinite size-range) comes the tip of a triangle which symbolizes evolution. From evolution, then, comes the brain diagram with dopamine & serotonin across the visual and linguistic brainhalves, and a lower box which is our 3-category emotional repertoire; the most common 4 emotions in our idle society being power-hungryness (how to elevate oneself in the socioeconomic hierarchy if one is a man; and for females itÂ´s mapping the status-hierarchy of men in their social group as to find them
differently attractive), expanding oneÂ´s world-view, planning sex and planning resource-gathering/work. This makes for a multi-symbol diagram involving the existential theoryÂ´s three pillars holding up the square-triangle-brain (size-time-diagram, evolution, brain) diagram.
Certain truth is or leads to distinction, which itself â€“ as all distinct things are â€“ is part of anti-distinction. This is like saying obvious things about the reality/everyday world in front of us: such as that size is infinite and that it is something in nothing. All this, in turn, leads us to draw a square: a size-time diagram with infinity-symbols in all 4 corners. From the middle of the known size-range, then, comes a triangle â€“ evolution â€“ which ends up in the brain with serotonine, dopamine, two brainhalves, a cortex and an emotional repertoire (upper- and lower box). In the emotional repertoire there are 4 idle emotions, among them â€œseeking powerâ€ â€“ power here is defined as outcompeting other males (if oneself is male) in a status competition, but the principle of diminishing other malesÂ´ reproductive capabilities happened at several stages in evolution: males fighting males (growing bigger to become dinosaurs) or viruses hijacking reproductive mechanisms of single-celled organisms. The search for power thus has led to brain-size growing (when competing for upwardness in hierarchies) but also things like T-rexÂ´s claws or the 1918 flu â€“ not to mention war.
Previous atheists have moved God from a place where do intervenes in everyday life using miracles, to a God that set everything in motion but then doesnÂ´t intervene. My philosophy places God as a bum who watches a skyscraper get built â€“ the bum then gets praised for the skyscraper getting built even though the bum didnÂ´t contribute anything: at most he watched as other mechanisms got everything done. Or God is a football fan who cheers at the players but doesnÂ´t himself contribute to making goals. Natural mechanisms create the world â€“ no need to praise God.
We are half-way in a planetÂ´s history â€“ 4.5 billion years have passed and 5 billion remain. The theory you now know is, in other words, in cosmic majority â€“ more planets have it than not (if it takes approximately half of a planetÂ´s history to invent it and if it remains true for the rest of the planetÂ´s history). Most other planets i.e. the majority of extraterrestrials are ideological adherents of the theory. Spread this theory to get approval of the majority even though it lives light-years away. Currently 99.9% of the worldÂ´s population lives in the era of religions â€“ spread this theory to end religious wars and terrorism like 9/11. The world-view (the view/diagrams that explain the world) is the same in the cosmic majority.
IÂ´ve worked 10 years to invent this theory and as alone bearing it itÂ´s my responsibility that it spreads. The future civilization in which everyone has the same world-view thus is dependent on me. I feel a
unique ability to influence earthÂ´s future.
You, as one who has partaken of this rare knowledge, should also feel a responsibility about spreading it to change the world.
IÂ´ve talked about the emotional repertoire in the brain-diagram. If we were to genetically engineer (DNA-manipulate) a next generation, we would A) give it an incredible sense of humor and knowledge so it could entertain us, and/or B) make it a super-happy retard â€“ retarded because positive emotions donÂ´t motivate â€“ they pacify â€“ so super-happy is equal to looking like a mongoloid; needs and wants and everything that drives us is painful â€“ pain motivates while super-happiness pacifies. We would, by creating these DNA-engineered emotional repertoires (to accomplish the dual
goal of incredible happiness and incredible entertainers/comedians/philosophers), be doing something that is done on other planets â€“ these are universal engineering goals.
You know that gold plate we sent up into space for aliens to find? It had etched on it images of man, some music, some other picturesâ€¦ We didnÂ´t send up the diagram discussed in this book. If the aliens see the gold plate we did send up, theyÂ´ll read between the lines â€“ seeing that there is no universal diagram â€“ and conclude that: â€œon earth they still believe in godsâ€.
You know how most people dedicate a large part of their lives to religion? Once they understand my tattoo (diagram) theyÂ´ll ask themselves: â€œwhat the hell have I been praying to?â€ It resembles a tiny needle popping a big balloon.
If this book goes mainstream, the future becomes so interesting that one forgets oneÂ´s everyday problems.
Interesting important things relieve
anxiety
(especially when they contain humor like a universal tattoo).
Nazis were friends with Nazis, communists were friends with communists, USA was friends with USA, when jihadists meet they share the same ideology and thus bond quickly. My theory/ideology/religion-replacer is empathy-increasing.
The more things people agree upon the better.
In the diagram/tattoo there are about 16 â€œlinesâ€ (hundreds if we consider the emotional repertoire being drawn the same on other planets). The sport is to draw as many universal lines as possible â€“ drawn from science so they can be drawn from science anywhere in the infinite universe.
God is a war-motivator. They say â€œthere are no atheists in trenchholesâ€. You need a bit of God to do war.
ItÂ´s hard to be an atheist warrior. My book, by disproving god, thus makes motivation for war less.
Gods contribute nothing â€“ one will have the full human experience-repertoire without gods.
Rather no direction than the wrong direction â€“ gods only contribute to war; itÂ´s better to be tolerantly caveman, uncaring of ideologies/world-views, than to be religious.
It seems mean to say that â€œitÂ´s their fault that religious wars keep on going â€“ those that wonÂ´t studyâ€, but itÂ´s good marketing.
Accomplices.
This book is worth you reading if it solves (or significantly helps) a major problem.
It is good marketing of my book to outline
the problem that I solve here.
USA is better than war, right? USA has poor folks committing crime â€“ thatÂ´s far better than nations waring. I move the problem from a macro-scale where nations fight eachother over oil, to an individualistic/family-based/friendship-based micro-scale where everyone feels as ideological/religious comrades â€“ empathy and friendship-buildingly sharing the knowledge of this book. I can get everyone to have the same ideology/religion-replacement so that thereÂ´ll be no war over the oil that has made us rich enough to not witness babies dying every day. Nations, races, ideologies, religions â€“ large groups â€“ makes the difference between war and crime. I solve the problems of macro-war and the friendship problem once everyone knows my diagrams. The post-oil decline isnÂ´t going to be pretty but we can take all measures to alleviate it â€“ spread this book.
If God is defined as â€œthe reason for existenceâ€ and I present a complete existential theory as a diagram, and I tattoo the diagram on my arm, is my
tattoo
then God? No, just a symbol for the reason for existence. One can tattoo an explanatory model for existence and God has during thousands of years been defined as the cause for existence.
My philosophy is to be real (to have an accurate concept of reality) but talking to religious people is like drifting away into a novel â€“ itÂ´s fiction but it (in some people) is beautiful. The greatest qualm I have about publishing my science is that it strips away the beautiful fiction novel as well as the hideous terrorism.
Why is it that the correct existential theory (which presumably should only be a big bang-type theory) inevitably is an arguemtn against imaginary friends/lords? Couldnâ€™t God exist without having created the universe? God certainly didnÂ´t create the universe but religious people could have an imaginary friend despite that. A powerless god â€“ a pet god.
We have about 60 years to publish this science because after that the world economy starts going downhill and what today is â€œjustâ€ a trillion dollar thing (dealing with religion in the middle east) will become a clash of civilizations (as long as a billion people believe in the revealed word of Muhammed and form an anti-atheist group based on that). But imagine if I become known as the one who ended islam â€“ during the past 2 decades islam has cost USA 6 trillion dollars. If I end religious war for good and get a piece of the pie (some of what the world will save by not having religious war)â€¦
Ending religion might even have unforeseen consequences like if religion is a major brain-drain or if having a uniting global ideology spurs friendship so much so that the world needs less military spending.
If religion is ended tomorrow the USA can reduce its military spending because the main trouble-zone (the religious middle east) is gone (converted to atheism). A large US military in a world full of conflict is as powerful as a small US military in a world where my science is mainstream. The world is messed up because it lacks my science and that warrants a big US military presence. If my science was known the US would need as much global military reach as is needed between California and Oregon. 1 billion people reading a holy book which says that atheists should be killed warrants a big military presence.
A much smaller US military is sufficient to quell all atheist conflicts.
Every fool has said â€œif all people would think just like me thereÂ´d be world-peaceâ€ but I have the opportunity to say that for real because all people need to do is learn a page of new science.

Texten bÃ¶rjar med sÃ¤ker sanning, sedan gÃ¥r den till att fÃ¶rklara varfÃ¶r nÃ¥gonting existerar istÃ¤llet fÃ¶r ingenting (den existentiella teorin â€“ varfÃ¶r vi existerar), sedan gÃ¥r den till evolutionÃ¤r teori vilket fÃ¶rutsÃ¤gs av den existentiella teorin. Den evolutionÃ¤ra teorin fÃ¶rklarar vardagsfenomen.
Du vet med sÃ¤kerhet att du tÃ¤nker och att du existerar eftersom om du skulle bliva lurad av en allsmÃ¤ktig demon som fÃ¶rsÃ¶ker lura dig i allt du kan bli lurad i, sÃ¥ Ã¤r lurendrejeriet i sig en tanke-process och dÃ¤rfÃ¶r vet du att tankar existerar (du tÃ¤nker). FÃ¶r att du ska bli lurad sÃ¥ mÃ¥ste du existera och dÃ¤rfÃ¶r vet du â€jag existerarâ€. Att bli lurad Ã¤r en tankeprocess och tÃ¤nkaren Ã¤r nÃ¶dvÃ¤ndig fÃ¶r att det ska finnas nÃ¥gon som blir lurad. SÃ¥ du vet: oavsett vad sÃ¥ tÃ¤nker du och existerar du. Ã…vanstÃ¥ende Ã¤r tvÃ¥ saker, eller hur? De Ã¤r bÃ¥da del av samma hjÃ¤rna och samma tankeprocess kan bli ens analytiska verktygssats/tÃ¤nkare, men vi erkÃ¤nner Ã¤ndÃ¥ att det finns distinkta entiteter â€“ att det finns distinktion. Detta kan ocksÃ¥ kallas separation. Vad Ã¤r distinktions motsats, anti-distinktion? Det Ã¤r en verklighet; det som allt Ã¤r del av; den Ã¤r en och dess definition i ordboken Ã¤r att allt Ã¤r del av den. Om vi skriver distinktion (tÃ¤nkare och tanke) pÃ¥ vÃ¤nster sida av ett papper och anti-distinktion (verkligheten; det som allt Ã¤r del av; en) pÃ¥ hÃ¶ger sida av pappret â€“ kan den vÃ¤nstra sidan se den hÃ¶gra sidan? Nej, fÃ¶r att oppositionen mellan distinktion och anti-distinktion. Det finns alltid en observerare (tÃ¤nkaren) och dÃ¤rmed distinktion i varje observation och dÃ¤rmed kan anti-distinktion ej representeras/ses.
HjÃ¤rnan evolverade fÃ¶r att hantera naturliga fenomen â€“ det fanns aldrig ett scenario i historien dÃ¥ nÃ¥gonting osynligt behÃ¶vde hanteras och betÃ¤nkas. DÃ¤rfÃ¶r antar vi att tanke-processen blev fel nÃ¤r vi sÃ¤ger att distinktion/vi inte kan se anti-distinktion/verkligheten. Men tankeprocessen gick inte fel: allt det betyder Ã¤r att det finns mer till verkligheten Ã¤n kan representeras. Oavsett hur vagt â€representerasâ€ Ã¤r definierat, lÃ¥t oss sÃ¤ga att en kaffekopp â€“ oavsett om hjÃ¤rnor Ã¤r involverade eller inte â€“ antas fÃ¶rsÃ¶ka representera det som allt Ã¤r del av, dÃ¥ gÃ¶r anti-distinktions-distinktions-oppositionen (motsÃ¤ttningen mellan distinktion och dess motsats) att representationen Ã¤r inkorrekt. Vi kan frÃ¥ga om en anti-distinkt â€sakâ€ har en maximumstorlek och dÃ¤rmed distinktion? Nej. PÃ¥ samma not Ã¤r ett annat bevis fÃ¶r att storleksskalan Ã¤r oÃ¤ndlig Ã¤r att vi ser nÃ¥gonting (vÃ¥r vardagsvÃ¤rld) samt kan gÃ¶ra hypoteser ad infinitum, och Ã¤ndÃ¥ representerar ingenting ALL verklighet. Verkligheten dvs storlek-tid Ã¤r dÃ¤rfÃ¶r oÃ¤ndligt.
En oÃ¤ndlig storleksskala Ã¤r en av pelarna i den existentiella teorin. En annan pelare Ã¤r att energimassa och rumtid Ã¤r motsatser (opposition) men sammanflÃ¤tade sÃ¥som i E=mc
2
(dÃ¤r c
2
hÃ¤nvisar till en hastighet dvs rum Ã¶ver tid: rumtid). Multiplikationen sammanfÃ¶r energimassa tillsammans med rumtid; ingenting tillsammans med nÃ¥gonting/allting; existens tillsammans med icke-existens. VarfÃ¶r finns det existens i form av min kropp? Utan att gÃ¥ in i det historiska svaret sÃ¥ kan man fÃ¶rklara det genom att sÃ¤ga att kroppen Ã¤r nÃ¥gonting i (sammanflÃ¤tat med) ingenting, av en storlek i en oÃ¤ndlig storleks-skala (dÃ¤r relationen mellan vilka tvÃ¥ storlekar som helst (eller objekt av tvÃ¥ storlekar) Ã¤r att de Ã¤r fÃ¶rklaringen till varandra dvs rÃ¤ttfÃ¤rdigar varandra. Sedan finns det ocksÃ¥, som tredje pelare, distinktions-anti-distinktions-opposition dvs vi lever i en singular (ej plural) verklighet men ser distinkta/separata entiteter sÃ¥som tÃ¤nkare och tanke.
PÃ¥ tal om rumtid, rumtid Ã¤r den logiska startpunkten fÃ¶r den tidsbaserade existentiella teorin. Ingenting (tom rumtid) behÃ¶ver inget inledande/tidigare rÃ¤ttfÃ¤rdigande eller anledning att existera, fÃ¶r att det existerar inte. I den, hursomhelst, Ã¤r naturlagarna sanna dvs den Ã¤r inte irrationell / anti-logisk, och bland naturlagarna finns de som, inklusive E=mc
2
, som nÃ¤mner energimassa. Skulle energimassa kunna â€nÃ¤mnasâ€ utan att det skulle existera? Om â€jaâ€ sÃ¥ skulle det vara absurt / anti-logiskt. VarfÃ¶r skulle verkligheten nÃ¤mna saker som aldrig existerar? Eftersom naturlagarna Ã¤r strikta och tack vare vÃ¥r regel â€det som nÃ¤mns mÃ¥ste existera eller uppstÃ¥â€ sÃ¥ fÃ¥r vi, varÃ¤n (i de minsta storlekarna) dÃ¤r E=mc
2
nÃ¤mns, sÃ¥ finns existens och dÃ¤rfÃ¶r en tÃ¤t big bang. Faktumet att galaxer rusar ivÃ¤g accelererandes frÃ¥n varandra leder till ingenting (tom rymd) i framtiden, och med mellanhanden â€naturlagarâ€ sÃ¥ uppstÃ¥r energimassa igen sÃ¥ tÃ¤t som den kan vara. Ingen tids-delay mellan ingenting â€“ naturlagar â€“ energimassa men sÃ¥ snart en begrÃ¤nsad (av event-horizons som bestÃ¤ms av ljuset Ã¤ndliga hastighet) region blir ingenting/tomrum, sÃ¥ uppstÃ¥r en big bang som sedan genom kosmisk expansion blir ingenting igen, som sedan blir tomrum och en ny big bang igen. Detta Ã¤r den tidsmÃ¤ssiga beskrivningen om varfÃ¶r energimassa (som existerar sammanflÃ¤tad med rumtid sÃ¥som i E=mc
2
) bÃ¶rjar tÃ¤t och blir ingenting, och sedan repetitation.
Det Ã¥vanstÃ¥ende Ã¤r en rivalteori till â€Gud skapade jorden pÃ¥ 6 dagar och vilade pÃ¥ den sjundeâ€. Den Ã¤r inte intuitiv eftersom den har att gÃ¶ra med saker som vi inte hade att gÃ¶ra med under evolutionen: osynliga energimassarumtid/verkligheten/anti-distinktion som del av vÃ¥rt resonemang. Den har ocksÃ¥ en multi-anledning orsak fÃ¶r vÃ¥r existens: en tidsvis rationale involverandes bÃ¶rjan och slutet pÃ¥ big bang, kombinerad med en 3-pelares existentiell teori som rÃ¤ttfÃ¤rdigar storlek och energimassa. Den Ã¤r abstrakt/vetenskaplig men kan inte reduceras till simplare termer. Det Ã¤r den minsta gemensamma nÃ¤mnaren som alla kan tro pÃ¥ (oavsett religion).
Hur vagt har verkligheten definerat â€att representeraâ€?
OÃ¤ndligt vagt â€“ vad som helst kan representera vad som helst.
Ã„r representationen/representÃ¶ren verkligheten eller Allah?
Nej.
Kan nÃ¥gonting representera det som allt Ã¤r del av?
Nej.
DÃ¥ Ã¤r storleks-tids-diagrammet oÃ¤ndligt dvs inget representerar verkligheten. Hur mÃ¥nga Ã¤r den? Hur mÃ¥nga Ã¤r Allah? 1.
Sa denâ€¦, eller skrev den en bok?
Detta motbevisar att Allah skrev en bok.
Igen: hur mycket av verkligheten kan representeras av, sÃ¤g, en mÃ¥lning? All den?
Nej, hela verkligheten kan ej representeras. Precis som Allah inte kan fÃ¥ngas i ett ord/en bild.
Vi kan ha hypoteser â€“ hur mÃ¥nga hypoteser kan vi ha?
Om verkligheten Ã¤r storlekar och tider, energimassa och rumtid sÃ¥ Ã¤r det rektangulÃ¤ra storleks-tids-diagrammet med energimassarumtid i varje koordinat det universella sÃ¤ttet att representera allt som finns att representera.
Skriver den bÃ¶cker? Nej, den Ã¤r inte av fÃ¶rfattarnatur.
â€Gud sa till Muhammed ord fÃ¶r ordâ€¦â€ Ã¤r alltsÃ¥ ett falskt eller som mest ett metaforiskt pÃ¥stÃ¥ende.
â€Du mÃ¥ste gÃ¶ra ritualer fÃ¶r att inte hamna i helvetet, och i himmelen fÃ¥r du 72 oskulderâ€ Ã¤r med samma logik ocksÃ¥ ett falskt pÃ¥stÃ¥ende.
Det finns tre alternativ som fundament fÃ¶r denna logik â€“ kan du tÃ¤nka ut ett fjÃ¤rde?
1: Verkligheten Ã¤r ett synonym fÃ¶r Allah,
2: eller sÃ¥ finns inte Allah
3: eller sÃ¥ finns 72 oskulder (ej ett alternativ eftersom verkligheten inte Ã¤r av den naturen, dÃ¥ den Ã¤r storleks-tids-energimassarumtid, att den skriver bÃ¶cker).
Som tillÃ¤gg till det rektangulÃ¤ra storleks-tids-diagrammet med oÃ¤ndlighetssymboler i varje hÃ¶rn, och den evolutionÃ¤ra triangeln som representerar att livet blev mer komplext ju mer tiden gick (triangelns spets har sitt ursprung i mittersta storleken i den kÃ¤nda storleksskalan), finns fÃ¶ljande hjÃ¤rn-diagram:
Den existentiella teorin med dess tre pelare, dvs en oÃ¤ndlig storleksskala, energimassarumtid och distinktions-anti-distinktions-opposition, fÃ¶rutsÃ¤ger att det borde finnas en liten bit DNA som kopierar sig.
Evolutionsteorin bÃ¶rjar med den fÃ¶rsta reproducerande formen. Det var en form som samlande kringliggande massa till en liknande form. Den existentiella teorin fÃ¶rutsÃ¤ger existensen av oÃ¤ndligt mÃ¥nga sÃ¥dana former. Det som oundvikligen blir sant nÃ¤r man har reproduktion Ã¤r att vissa dÃ¶r medan andra Ã¶verlever (liv och dÃ¶d), att antalet avkomma/kopior formen gÃ¶r har betydelse och att det finns mutationer Ã¶ver tid. FÃ¶ljande Ã¤r sant om formens avkomma: vissa dÃ¶r medan andra Ã¶verlever, antalet avkomma har betydelse och avkomman Ã¤r annorlunda frÃ¥n originalformen. Dessa tre regler / naturlagar var inaktiva innan den fÃ¶rsta reproduktionen skedde. NÃ¤sta stora steg var nÃ¤r ett av dessa former mÃ¶jliggjorde fÃ¶r sig sjÃ¤lv att injicera sitt DNA in i andra formers reproduktiva mekanism, vilket utnyttjade princip nr 2: att antalet avkomma har betydelse. Det var det fÃ¶rsta viruset: den hijackade andras reproduktion. Regeln / naturlagen som kom i spel i.om. denna hÃ¤ndelse var att â€maktâ€ har betydelse: att hijacka andras reproduktiva mekanism ger evolutionÃ¤ra fÃ¶rdelar. Nu har vi lagt fram de fyra huvudregelerna som Ã¤r evolutionsteori: fÃ¶rst kom de tre fÃ¶rsta reglerna, sedan kom den fjÃ¤rde: makt. NÃ¤sta stora hÃ¤ndelse â€“ fÃ¶r att skydda mot att virus hijackar alla reproduktiva system â€“ var att ett immunsystem evolverade fÃ¶r att skydda mot virus hijacks-fÃ¶rsÃ¶k. Detta behÃ¶vde multicellulÃ¤rism. Precis som immunsystem krÃ¤ver multicellularism, sÃ¥ behÃ¶ver immunsystem multikÃ¶nadhet: fÃ¶r att vinna i kampen dÃ¤r virus muterar fÃ¶r att kringgÃ¥ immunsystem sÃ¥ behÃ¶ver immunsystemet ocksÃ¥ maximalt med mutation. Att mixa gener frÃ¥n tvÃ¥ kÃ¶n skapar ett mer muterat immunsystem, vilket hÃ¥ller ut i kampen mot virus dÃ¤r virus â€fÃ¶rsÃ¶kerâ€ mutera sig runt immunsystemet. Den nÃ¤sta stora hÃ¤ndelsen var att en av dessa multicellulÃ¤ra organismer â€“ en fisk eller mask â€“ av det manliga kÃ¶net muterade till att vara agressiv och fÃ¶rinta andra manliga varelser. Han skulle ha fÃ¥tt hÃ¶gre tillgÃ¥ng till kvinnliga organismer jÃ¤mfÃ¶rt med hans icke-agressiva likar. Detta kan ocksÃ¥ kallas â€maktâ€ eftersom agressiva hanar hijackar andra hanars tillgÃ¥ng till kvinnor genom att dÃ¶da hanarna. Detta orsakar dinosaurierna eftersom stÃ¶rre muskelmassa och skarpare vapen Ã¤r bÃ¤ttre pÃ¥ att dÃ¶da rivalerna. Bland dinosaurierna fanns moder-avkomma-bandet, ditplacerad av evolutionen eftersom det var en fÃ¶rdel fÃ¶r mÃ¶drar att se sina barn Ã¶verleva till vuxenskap. Detta band muterade till att involvera flock-medlemmar eftersom en grupp sammarbetandes bÃ¤ttre kan vinna Ã¶ver individualister i brÃ¥k om vad som helst. NÃ¤sta stora steg var att nÃ¥gon kartlade flocken, i sin hjÃ¤rna, som en hierarki (upp-ned-axeln) med en lÃ¤ngtan efter att stÃ¥ hÃ¶gst upp i hierarkin. Denna kapitalistiska tÃ¤vlan mot toppen gjorde att hjÃ¤rnan vÃ¤xte sig stÃ¶rre â€“ stÃ¶rre minnesbank, mer detaljrika fÃ¶rutsÃ¤gelser och snabbare planering Ã¤r alla fÃ¶rdelar som kommer frÃ¥n att ha ett stÃ¶rre kortex.
Du har en komposit-sÃ¤ker sanning bestÃ¥endes av tvÃ¥ sÃ¤kra sanningar: du kan med sÃ¤kerhet sÃ¤ga att du tÃ¤nker (fÃ¶r att om du skulle bli lurad: att bli lurad Ã¤r en tankeprocess) och att du existerar (eftersom att bli lurad krÃ¤ver den som blir lurad). Jag tÃ¤nker och jag finns Ã¤r ett pÃ¥stÃ¥ende men tvÃ¥ sanningar. Du kan med sÃ¤kerhet pÃ¥stÃ¥ dig ha â€distinktionâ€ eftersom du har att gÃ¶ra med multipla separata entiteter (sÃ¥som â€jagâ€ och â€tankarâ€). Man kan sÃ¤ga, nÃ¤r man ser den sÃ¤kra sanningens â€jag tÃ¤nkerâ€ och â€jag existerarâ€, att avstÃ¥endet/mellanrummet mellan de tvÃ¥ idÃ©erna (tÃ¤nkare och tanke) Ã¤r distinktion. AvstÃ¥endet/mellanrummet som separarar tÃ¤nkare frÃ¥n tanke Ã¤r nÃ¶dvÃ¤ndigt fÃ¶r â€disktinktionâ€ att hÃ¤rledas som sÃ¤ker sanning fÃ¶ljandes ur nÃ¤sta logiska steg, med ursprunget av den originella primÃ¤ra sÃ¤kra sanningen.
Ã„r alla distinkta entiteter del av en singulÃ¤r verklighet om â€verklighetenâ€ Ã¤r definierad som â€det som allt Ã¤r del avâ€? Med andra ord: om vi ritar distinktion pÃ¥ vÃ¤nster sida av ett papper och anti-distinktion (distinktionÂ´s motsats: en ensam verklighet â€“ det som allt Ã¤r del av. Zoomandes ut maximalt) pÃ¥ hÃ¶ger sida av pappret, kan dÃ¥ distinktion representera hÃ¶ger sida av pappret dvs anti-distinktion? Hur skulle nÃ¥gon distinkt entitet kunna vara/representera motsatsen till vad representation/distinktion Ã¤r? Vilken representation som helst av anti-distinktion/verkligheten mÃ¥ste ha minst tre entiteter: tÃ¤nkare, mellanrummet mellan tÃ¤nkare och tanke, och tanke.
Separation/distinktion Ã¤r antaget i representation, vilket innebÃ¤r att anti-distinktion Ã¤r orepreserbart.
Hur vagt har universum/Gud definerat vad en representation Ã¤r dvs nÃ¤r en representation sker? VÃ¥ra hjÃ¤rnor anvÃ¤nder neuroner fÃ¶r att representera, men vad sÃ¤gs om â€“ istÃ¤llet fÃ¶r neuroner (oavsett om hjÃ¤rnor Ã¤r inblandade eller inte) â€“ universum lÃ¥ter vilket slumpmÃ¤ssigt valt objekt som helst lÃ¥ta sig sÃ¤gas, sÃ¥som neuroner sÃ¤gs, representera verkligheten? Universum har definierat â€representationâ€ oÃ¤ndligt vagt dvs uteslutandes hjÃ¤rnor sÃ¥ kan vilket slumpmÃ¤ssigt objekt som helst spotant bli/vara symbolen fÃ¶r all verklighet â€“ fÃ¶r att universum har definierat â€representeraâ€ oÃ¤ndligt vagt. Trots den oÃ¤ndligt vaga definitionen av vad som representerar vad, sÃ¥ gÃ¶r distinktions-anti-distinktions-oppositionen (linjen som separerar vÃ¤nster sida av pappret frÃ¥n hÃ¶ger sida; motsÃ¤ttningen mellan distinktion och anti-distinktion) att verkligheten Ã¤r orepresenterbar. Om verkligheten Ã¤r anti-distinktion dÃ¥ finns ingen distinktion (representation Ã¤r oundvikligen distinktion), trots universums oÃ¤ndligt vaga definition av â€representeraâ€, fÃ¥nga verkligheten. I representationer kan vi rÃ¤kna minst tre saker och det vi fÃ¶rsÃ¶ker representera Ã¤r en sak utan nÃ¥gonting utanfÃ¶r den. Faktumet att representationer innehÃ¥ller distinktion gÃ¶r att att fÃ¥nga verkligheten (allt som ett) omÃ¶jligt.
Vi kan ha oÃ¤ndligt mÃ¥nga eller oÃ¤ndligt innehÃ¥llsfulla/stora representationer/hypoteser â€“ sÃ¥som ett oÃ¤ndligt storleks-tids-diagram â€“ och genom att abstrakt peka till verkligheten, sÃ¥ gÃ¶r universums regel att ingenting representerar verkligheten trots universums oÃ¤ndligt vaga definition av â€representeraâ€ av oÃ¤ndligt mycket, gÃ¶r verkligheten orepresenterbar. Detta kan bara betyda en sak: verkligheten â€“ som vi kÃ¤nner som storlekar och tider (ett storleks-tids-diagram) â€“ Ã¤r oÃ¤ndligt. Det finns oÃ¤ndligt stort och oÃ¤ndligt litet med oÃ¤ndligt mycket dÃ¥tid och oÃ¤ndligt mycket framtid. Detta rektangulÃ¤ra storleks-tids-diagram dvs vÃ¥r vardagsvÃ¤rld av storlek-tid har oÃ¤ndligheter Ã¶verallt.
Energimassa i rumtid: ett i noll, existens i icke-existens, nÃ¥gonting i ingenting â€“ sÃ¥som definierats av E=mc
2
dÃ¤r c
2
stÃ¥r fÃ¶r ljusets hastighet (rum Ã¶ver tid dvs rumtid/noll/icke-existens) och E=m refererar till energimassa (existens, nÃ¥gonting, allt).
Distinktions-anti-distinktions-opposition: vi lever i en singulÃ¤r verklighet men vi ser multipla objekt.
En oÃ¤ndlig storleksskala.
De Ã¥vanstÃ¥ende tre idÃ©erna Ã¤r en existentiell teori (en teori som fÃ¶rklarar existensen av en reproduktiv form dvs evolutions bÃ¶rjan dvs vÃ¥r existens). Det Ã¤r modernt att anvÃ¤nda sig av tre likvÃ¤rdiga idÃ©er fÃ¶r att fÃ¶rklara ens existens â€“ alla tidigare existentiella teorier har antingen anvÃ¤nt en enda idÃ© (monoteism) eller en saga/myt (mÃ¥nga vardagliga (ej vetenskapliga/abstrakta) idÃ©er) fÃ¶r att fÃ¶rklara existens.
Den fÃ¶rutsÃ¤gande kvalitÃ©n som gÃ¶r denna existentiella teori till en vetenskaplig teori Ã¤r att den, baserat pÃ¥ en oÃ¤ndlig storleksskala av energimassarumtid och distinktions-anti-distinktions-opposition, fÃ¶rutsÃ¤ger att det i en oÃ¤ndlig storleksskala borde finnas en storlek dÃ¤r reproduktion (DNA) sker. Den existentiella teorin fÃ¶rutsÃ¤ger det fÃ¶rsta DNA:t, och frÃ¥n det fÃ¥r vi evolutionÃ¤r teori.
En annan fÃ¶rutsÃ¤gande kvalitÃ© Ã¤r att teorin fÃ¶rutsÃ¤ger att big bang borde varit
tÃ¤t
. A-priori begynnelsen av universum Ã¤r logiskt sett tomhet eftersom tomhet inte behÃ¶ver nÃ¥gon tidigare/fÃ¶religgande logiskt rÃ¤ttfÃ¤rdigande eftersom det ej existerar. I tom rumtid Ã¤r naturlagarna sanna, sÃ¥som naturlagarna som hanterar energimassa (sÃ¥som E=mc
2
), och dÃ¤rfÃ¶r bÃ¶rjar big bang oÃ¤ndligt tÃ¤t â€“ fÃ¶r att E=mc
2
Ã¤r lika sann samtidigt i de minsta storlekarna. De minsta tomma rymderna hade E=mc
2
som sann inom sig direkt nÃ¤r det fanns ingenting, vilket fÃ¶rutsÃ¤ger en tÃ¤t big bang. En region, inom event horizons gjorda av energimassa rusandes ivÃ¤g i >c (pga mÃ¶rk energi accelererandes kosmisk expansion) Ã¤r per definition â€ingentingâ€ i vilket E=mc
2
Ã¤r sann i de minsta utrymmena, vilket Ã¥stadkommer en big bang utom rÃ¤ckhÃ¥ll fÃ¶r de nÃ¤rmaste ( v = >c) energimassa. Ingenting (utom rÃ¤ckhÃ¥ll fÃ¶r nÃ¤rmaste energimassa fÃ¶r att den Ã¤r pÃ¥ vÃ¤g bortÃ¥t i >c) orsakas i centrumpunkten som har event horizons som grÃ¤ns lÃ¤ngst bort, vilket leder till en big bang (eftersom naturlagarna uppbringar energimassa i det tomma centrumet).
Det Ã¤r en stor historisk hÃ¤ndelse att det Ã¤ntligen finns ett ateistiskt argument i form av en universitetskurs: det Ã¤r en existentiell teori plus evolution som inte behÃ¶ver en personifierad gud fÃ¶r att fungera, utan dess pelare (oÃ¤ndlig storleksskala av energimassarumtid och distinktions-anti-distinktions-opposition) kan inte ha en personifierad gud tillagd till dem som en fjÃ¤rde pelare utan att teorin lÃ¥ter lÃ¶jlig. Det Ã¤r inte bara sÃ¥ att teorin inte behÃ¶ver en personifierad gud, utan att lÃ¤gga till en gud fÃ¶rstÃ¶r teorins minimalistiska rationellt kompletta skÃ¶nhet. Gudar fÃ¶rfular teorin. Teorins upptÃ¤ckt Ã¤r en stor historisk hÃ¤ndelse eftersom aldrig fÃ¶rr har en hel kurs (bÃ¶rjandes med sÃ¤ker sanning, gÃ¥endes genom den existentiella teorin och slutandes i evolution) lagts fram i ateismens intellektuella debatt, som ett argument mot en personifierad gud.
Anatomin i hjÃ¤rnan frÃ¥n att hÃ¶ra sÃ¤ker sanning (jag tÃ¤nker & jag finns) â€“ bÃ¶rjan av denna kurs â€“ skapar samma neuronala pathways / associationer mellan idÃ©er i varje person som hÃ¶r vet sÃ¤ker sanning. Det logiska steget till â€distinktionâ€ Ã¤r att notera, som meta-analys av den primÃ¤ra sÃ¤kra sanningen â€“ att man har mÃ¥nga idÃ©er (jag tÃ¤nker OCH jag finns) och att man kan ta den logiska vÃ¤gen till nÃ¤sta steg i kursen (distinktion finns). Att sedan motsÃ¤tta anti-distinktion med distinktion skapar den ofÃ¶rnimmbara â€“ â€mot resonâ€ (eftersom logik Ã¤r, i simpla mÃ¤nniskor, enbart visuell) â€“ slutsatsen att vi/distinktion inte kan se verkligheten/anti-distinktion. Distinktions-anti-distinktions-oppositionen Ã¤r svÃ¥rbegriplig fÃ¶r att den â€“ sÃ¥som formell logik eller matematik â€“ enbart anvÃ¤nder ord istÃ¤llet fÃ¶r bilder (den lingvistiska hjÃ¤rnhalvan istÃ¤llet fÃ¶r den visuella). Vi evolverade till att sÃ¤ga â€om jag kan se det sÃ¥ tror jag pÃ¥ detâ€ och det Ã¤r en god tumregel eftersom praktiska sekvenser hÃ¤ndelser kan verifieras som sanna eller osanna genom att visualisera dem. Men i denna filosofi: nej â€“ det mÃ¥ste vara lingvistiskt att vi fÃ¶rnekar oss sjÃ¤lva konceptet â€all verklighetâ€, vilket leder till slutsatsen att det finns mer till verkligheten Ã¤n nÃ¥gonting â€“ oavsett hur vagt universum definerat â€att representeraâ€ â€“ representerar. Detta tillÃ¤gger oÃ¤ndligt mÃ¥nga storlekar till vÃ¥r abstrakta stoorleksskala / storleks-tids-diagrammet; det gÃ¶r en rektangel (med storlek pÃ¥ y-axeln och tid pÃ¥ x-axeln) med oÃ¤ndlighetstecken i varje hÃ¶rn, som i sin tur blir en pelare i vÃ¥r personlig-gud-fÃ¶rnekande existentiella teori.
Att komma frÃ¥n sÃ¤ker sanningen genom enbart logiska steg (meta-analyser och motsÃ¤ttningsskapande av motsatser) till en existentiell teori som fÃ¶rutsÃ¤er evolutionen Ã¤r en stor historisk hÃ¤ndelse i ateismens historia.
I ett historiskt sammanhang Ã¤r anatomin (neurala anslutningar mellan idÃ©er och sekvenser logik) som skapas av denna kurs som ett paradigm-shifte in i en ny era av civilisation â€“ en era liknande den som finns pÃ¥ oÃ¤ndligt mÃ¥nga planeter vars vetenskap kommit lÃ¤ngre Ã¤n vÃ¥ra 4.5 miljarder Ã¥rs mittenpunkt i en vanlig vattenbÃ¤rande planets historia.
Evolution, genom att bÃ¶rja frÃ¥n â€en massa som samlar kringliggande massa till en liknande formâ€ kliver fram frÃ¥n den existentiella teorins oÃ¤ndliga storleksskala av energimassarumtid. Om vi antar att DNA Ã¤r replikationsmolekylen sÃ¥ kan vi ta steget till â€“ klivandes Ã¶ver hur cellvÃ¤ggar evolverade osv â€“ till att virus hijackar andras reproduktiva system. Detta â€“ i den universella inter-planetÃ¤ra rymdvarelsekulturen â€“ formuleras som, i bÃ¶cker av logik, som att de tre fÃ¶rsta reglerna uppkommer (liv/dÃ¶d, antalet avkomma har betydelse och â€det sker mutationer i varje generationsskifteâ€) och sedan att en fjÃ¤rde regel uppkommer (makt, med virus). Denna historia â€“ som i vÃ¥r kurs bÃ¶rjar frÃ¥n den fÃ¶rsta reproduktiva formen och slutar i att finslipa anatomin bakom makt i mÃ¤n â€“ Ã¤r visualiseringsbar som en grottmanna-historias narrativ likt dem vi evolverade till att se/hÃ¶ra. Vi kan proof-checka/validera historian genom att se den visuellt. Evolutions visuella natur Ã¤r i stark kontrast till den rent linguistiska/abstraka natur som den existentiella teorin har.
PÃ¥ tal om â€abstraktaâ€ beskrivningar dvs beskrivningar som gÃ¶r det vÃ¤ldigt klart fÃ¶r oss att vÃ¥r fÃ¶rstÃ¥else av universum bara Ã¤r en karta (en referens) och inte verkligheten i sig (tÃ¤nk pÃ¥ PlatoÂ´s och KantÂ´s grottmetafor och â€saken Ã¤r inte saken sjÃ¤lvâ€-filosofierâ€)â€¦ Storleksskalan av energimassarumtid, i storleken av kvantfysik har oss beskrivandes fotoner etc anvÃ¤ndandes bÃ¥de vÃ¥g-beskrivningar med fokus pÃ¥ lÃ¤ngder i rymd (dessa Ã¤r â€rumtids-beskrivningarâ€) OCH â€“ i vÃ¥r-partikel-dualitet â€“ energimassabeskrivningen dvs att energin i en foton Ã¤r dess fÃ¤rg. FÃ¤rg (sÃ¥som den uppfattas genom Ã¶gonen), vÃ¥g/rumtids-beskrivningen och partikel-energi/energimassa-beskrivningen Ã¤r alla legitimea beskrivningar av kvantfysiken. VÃ¥r fÃ¶rmÃ¥ga att beskriva vilken massa/vilket fenomen som helst med bÃ¥de energimassa- och rumtids-beskrivningar lÃ¶per genom hela storleksskalan. Du kan fÃ¶restÃ¤lla dig tvÃ¥ linjer â€“ en fÃ¶r energimassa och en fÃ¶r rumtid â€“ gÃ¥endes vertikalt genom alla bilder pÃ¥ storleks-axeln. TillÃ¤ggandes komplexitet pÃ¥ detta finns det tvÃ¥ linjer till â€“ tyngdlagen och elektromagnetism â€“ bÃ¥da gÃ¥endes lÃ¤ngs storleks-axeln, tyngdlagen har dess dualitet av energimassa- och rumtids-beskrivningar och elektromagnetism likasÃ¥ har desamma, dvs energimassa och rumtidsbeskrivningar. Tyngdlagen Ã¤r bÃ¥de Newtonisk â€massor dras till massorâ€ (energimassas fokus pÃ¥ massa) och Einsteinsk â€rumtids krÃ¶kningâ€ (rumtids fokus pÃ¥ rum) â€“ bÃ¥da beskrivningar Ã¤r korrekta.
Vi Ã¤r halvvÃ¤gs igenom en planets historia â€“ 4.5 miljarder Ã¥r har gÃ¥tt och 5 miljarder Ã¥terstÃ¥r. Teorin som du nu vet Ã¤r m.a.o. i kosmisk majoritet â€“ fler planeter har den Ã¤n har den inte (om det tar ungefÃ¤r hÃ¤lften av planetens historia att uppfinna den och om den kvarstÃ¥r under andra hÃ¤lften av planetens historia). De flesta andra planeter dvs majoriteten av rymdvarelser Ã¤r m.a.o. ideologiska anhÃ¤ngare av teorin. Sprid denna teori fÃ¶r att fÃ¥ bekrÃ¤ftelse av majoriteten trots att den bor ljusÃ¥r bort. Just nu lever 99.9% av jordens befolkning i eran av religioner â€“ sprid denna teori fÃ¶r att fÃ¥ slut pÃ¥ religiÃ¶sa krig samt terrorism sÃ¥som 9/11. VÃ¤rldsbilden (bilden/diagrammet som fÃ¶rklarar vÃ¤rlden) Ã¤r densamma i den kosmiska majoriteten.
Jag har jobbat i 10 Ã¥r fÃ¶r att Ã¥stadkomma teorin och som ensam om att kÃ¤nna till den Ã¤r det mitt ansvar att den sprids. Den framtida civilizationen i vilken alla har samma vÃ¤rldsbild hÃ¤nger dÃ¤rfÃ¶r pÃ¥ mig. Jag kÃ¤nner en unik mÃ¶jlighet att pÃ¥verka jordens framtid.

Can we
timetravel? We can proceed from era to era, just like dinosaurs preceded man and not vice versa â€“ its a universal sequence on any planet.
Heaven/karma instinctual but collides with main picture.
Water, primordial soup, proteins, dns strand. Single cell reproducing multiplying. Then 1 of these cells thought â€œill inject my own dna into some other cellâ€, hijack its reproductive system. Very beneficial. So first there were 3 rules: life n death, number of offspring matters and mutation in each generationshift, then with viruses came the 4th rule â€œpowerâ€ â€“ hijacking othersâ€™ reproductive system. Then theres an arms race between viruses and â€¦ â€œOur kind ofâ€ organism, so to mutate our immune system faster two genders arose. Then fights between males led to the dinosaurs. Then brains bonded into groups to fight individualists. Then capitalist power struggles within the group made the brain grow larger, weâ€™re good at planning and remembering things. Then we get to kingdoms. From the water puddle to the 21 st century. Those who proceed to the next era will live in a world where holy book-group bonds are weak and a universal courses group bond is the strongest, thus national wars or civilizational wars where identity is based on other than this science will be impossible. The planet has two future ways to go 60 years from now and one is better but needs some investment of time until everybody knows this course.
Theres a universal course/book thats on every advanced enough planet throughout the universe and at the regeneration of every universe. If you consider the entire corpus of human knowledge, youd find 3 rational starting points: certain truth, nothingness and that reality is one. Just like dinosaurs predate humans the first chapter with the 3 starting points predate the connecting of â€œi think n i exist, distinctionâ€ and â€œreality is one, antidistinction. Which leads to that there is more to reality than can be contemplated meaning that its infinite. Thats chaper 2: like multiplication and division are much higher levels of mathematics than adding and subtracting, chaper 2 is higher than the starting points in chapter 1.
â€”â€”â€”
If you want to be altruistic/selfless you can think about the millions of lives lost or living as refugees due to religious wars and group-loyalties based on ideology/religion. What if group-loyalty could be, for everyone, based on a single universal ideology? Then friendship ties, shared histories, well-mixing personalities and the like would form groups that donÂ´t have a religious mission/an ideological drive. When all ideologies are erased â€“ and religions too â€“ then simple biological mechanisms like common goals, shared interests and family ties bind us together â€“ and those kind of conglomerations are more likely to disintegrate than if there is a holy book or any ideological book as the binding principle between people. If ISIS would be educated then it would disintegrate and many civil wars break out among different families in Iraq/Syria â€“ but there would not be this major cleft between western&modern and holy&dogmatic.
If you want to be selfish like Ayn Rand: the upcoming world order / economy will be a meritocracy based on who advances or knows the most science. The ancient Chinese had a government where even the lowest peasant, if he passed a test in ConfusciousÂ´ teachings, could elevate himself higher in the society. Hierarchy is based on what is objectively to be admired; hierarchy is based on what infinitely many extraterrestrials in consensus have agreed upon be the criteria for how a humanÂ´s thoughts should be wired; hierarchy is based on the universeÂ´s disposition to reward those with the most accurate world-view or whom advance the pre-existing world-view and spread it to others â€“ the universe wants us choose to elevate in the hierarchy those whom appriciate the universe most fully, wholistically and most accurately. The old power-system based on money is upheld by banks and is based on present day humansÂ´ ties to the past. There will be an overlap between the old bank-based system for establishing VIP-status and the new economy which is a meritocracy based on science. If we want to be like planets ahead of us in the evolution of history, we ought to adapt the meritocracy-economy. After a few generations inherited money seems less legitimate than knowing or advancing science and by doing so wiring oneÂ´s cortex (flexible thinking part of the brain) as universally as possible (as much like the consensus among extraterrestrials is as possible).
There are three universal starting points for the universal course which will wire your brain universally. What I mean by â€œuniversalâ€ is that:
A) it is based on science meaning that it is retrievable from anywhere at any time; it is available universally unlike some time-specific language-specific location-specific holy-book-revalation.
B) universal means that it is how aliens/extraterrestrials sooner or later wire their brains. Sure: they can choose to live in a multi-worldviewical world but sooner or later the truth will conquer meaning that all various ideas among every tribe or nation will congregate (like a lens focuses many beams of light into one focal point) into a single set of ideas and prioritarizations â€“ a single world-view will emerge from the many. It is the identical world-view that all civilizing planets will congregate to/toward because science is universal. This congregating is as much of a universal step in evolution as that a planet with water will eventually have bacteria. Eventually everyone will know the course and the idea of this book. â€œWhat do you believe?â€ will no longer be a question because everyone has wired their cortexÂ´s ideas based on universal ideas/science.

Am I a muslim?
I have my size-time-diagram into which everything fits and this diagram being infinite gives an existential theory because:
â€“ sizes justify (are the cause of) one another, so thereÂ´s infinite justification.
â€“ time is infinite and our universe is observed to become nothingness in the future, and nothingness would be absurd if not for the fact that in the smallest spaces energymass is summoned because E=mc2 is a stable, constant law of nature.
â€“ there can only be separate distinct entities if distinction is counter-balanced and happens in non-distinction (a singular Reality). This point is much like the previous point of that only in nothingness can somethingness be summoned.
God, then, if we are to look for a meaning for the word, cannot be:
â€“ a specific object, size nor time within something infinitely larger
â€“ cannot, by definition, be apart from and â€œbeyondâ€ [that of which all is part] (Reality). Reality being an infinite size- and time-range of energymasspacetime is enough of an existential theory to explain us being here, the Big Bang, and the rest of the questions. God would, if claimed to be â€œbeyondâ€ the existential theory, be an unnecessary unproven assumption but more to the point: God would be â€œunrealâ€ if Reality is defined as we define it here. Such â€œbeyond Realityâ€-gods are unreal. WhatÂ´s more is that the phrase â€œAllah akbarâ€ (God is the biggest/greatest) wouldnÂ´t be true if Reality/[that of which all is part] is God plus Reality â€“ if [that of which all is part] has two major components, God and an energymasspacetime sizerange etc (the existential theory), then the sum of those two components is greater than God.
God, thus, obviously means Reallity by the definition of God being the greatest. God is then infinite. It makes sense to see people in awe over how much they can study, when they know thereÂ´s infinitely many fields of science which we do not have access to but which are logical and necessities for Reality to hold together. There being nothing absurd in an infinite size-range that resembles our known size-range (from quantum physics to the visible universe) is awesome and the highest you could possibly worship. This again proves that God is just a synonym for Reality/the existential theory.
Having studied all fields of science i.e. all sizes is the known sizerange, seeing how they all make up (justify) eachother (that itÂ´s just zooming in and zooming out), the wisdom that the sizerange is infinite (that there are infinitely many sizes making up one another) from the distinction (I think & I am logical path) and anti-distinction (that Reality is one) -thing, is the reason why we exist and God is not some size (sizes are not minds, except through evolution). Having studied all known sizes and knowing that the sizerange is infinite: it is an explanation to why weÂ´re here (akin to the Adam and Eve story or â€œGod created earth in 6 daysâ€ story) but it is not a revalation-giving thing â€“ the Quran wasnÂ´t written by God because God is not the kind of thing that writes/dictates stories. God being an infinite sizerange as thus our Creator is true, but the true way to get knowledge, rituals/pictoral representations and even guidance is through my work, not the work of the holy book-writers. The holy book writers might have said something true about God (just like I do in my work) â€“ but that is true of science textbooks moreso â€“ and they all said false things such as that God talks/gives revalations/authors holy books.
I can see the bronze-age marketing-teamÂ´s standpoint: people are more prone to follow dictates if theyÂ´re said to come from something/someone â€œhigher than humanâ€ i.e. a God or a ghost/spirit. Being invisible in as nonsense-a-way as some rituals are, is great for marketing. Everyone knows how humans thing â€“ theyÂ´re themselves human; we are only partly rational (a computer is rational) in what we think â€“ all our animal lusts bias or interrupt the thoughts that are as logical as they get, but theyÂ´re always going to be based against an evolutionary background just like the pitfall that my abstract diagram-including infinity-mentioning world-view is more like algebra than â€œwhat a world-view (context in which we are) should be thinking about that we lived for millions of years on the savannah, only needing to know (in oneÂ´s world-view) where the water-source is or whom stands under whom in the social hierarchy. WeÂ´ve mapped geographies, the use-based properties of objects/tools and personalities (and still do) for a gazillion years â€“ only with the advent of science SOME of us achieved higher i.e. used their evolved meager toolkit with all its biases to scetch out something like the theory of evolution in the 1800s. Looking at the evolution of [what we use our memory for]/how we map our surroundings/our world-view, before we mapped social relationships we mapped geographies. Before we mapped the functions of inventions (tools) our map only contained caveman tools (sharp stones and spears). The next step is to map oneÂ´s context as an infinite size-time-diagram (where size and time are really the same, but abstract thinking allows us to separate them into two distinct axises) or energymasspacetime (with itsÂ´ many laws of nature found in every school textbook in the world) and the distinction-antidistinction-
thing which feels so awkward/abstract that one wonders why one needs it as pillar 3 of the existential theory: the answer is: it wasnÂ´t invented (the words â€œI see a distinct objectâ€ or â€œwhy is there distinction?â€ werenÂ´t said in the same breath as â€œReality is oneâ€ or â€œenergymass and spacetime uniteâ€) until I did it in the 21st century). It might seem trivial to mention that separate entities exist in a singular Reality â€“ itÂ´s so obvious (thatÂ´s why no-one cared to make a big fuzz out of inventing it) but it makes the existential theory have three pillars (all of which can seem obvious) and not 4 â€“ thereÂ´s nothing more to add to the existential theory once youÂ´ve added the obvious â€œseparation in antidistinctionâ€-statement. I want to know how aliens (the infinitely many of them, steered by science toward an incommon path) think because its synonymous to finding a TRUE â€œkey to historyâ€ (Marx thought the key was equality, Hitler thought the key was racial superiority and a brutally competative relationship between races, Capitalism thinks itÂ´s freedom (less government), some might think they â€œkey to historyâ€ is to fund technological development). â€œHow aliens thinkâ€ is a shorthand way of saying â€œthe key to historyâ€ or â€œwhat will happen next/eventually and in hindsight seen as akin to the era of ancient grecoroman culture, the Industrial Revolution or the Digital revolution)â€. ItÂ´s what weÂ´re steered towards; itÂ´s the closest thing we get to divine guidance. ItÂ´s simply universal (drawn on science and practiced by infinitely many aliens) guidance/suggestions/
recommendations that we, as a species, can choose to promogate and thus â€œfollowâ€ or if weÂ´ll stick to multiculturalismÂ´s many -ismÂ´s like political quran-based islamism or christian-based â€œthe holy book gave me thisâ€-morality and codes of conduct. Some -ismÂ´s are dangerous (like quran-based politics and law) while some -ismÂ´s like christianity give too much credit to the -ism for simple human decency (in an age of extreme wealth globally). When my tummy is full IÂ´m a decent person â€“ I try to make money but IÂ´m not desparate after extreme wealth because I know that my caveman-brainÂ´s â€œneedâ€ for power (through status-symbols and freedom of space my environment to maximize the effectiveness of my hobby (writing)) wonÂ´t get satisfied no matter what external extravaganzas trigger my eyeballs, nor can people (socializing) make me much more satisfied than I am right now because all that is interesting and that there is to people is their brain â€“ and after a few weeks together thereÂ´ll be nothing I know nor any mental tool that I use that wonÂ´t, despite copyright, be in the hands of my friend: we wonÂ´t talk science (me teaching him/her) after all the science has been taught. I donÂ´t care to teach trivia so when I say â€œI teach SCIENCEâ€ I mean a finite thing: the existential theory plus something from each level of the known sizerange. Getting a P.hD from specializing on finding the structure of a rare protein only found in the feet of Amazonian forrest-mice is to put your eyes too close to the diagram; P.hDs for specializing/having a very narrow topic for oneÂ´s mind to engage in are for people who donÂ´t see the forest for the trees and care to rather look at one leaf of one tree instead of thinking about and seeing the forest as a whole. IÂ´m a forest person â€“ a leaf 10 cm from my eyes just bugs me. ThatÂ´s why there is a finite repertoire to what I call â€œscienceâ€ â€“ it takes a few days for me (my accomplishment/my work) to be fully understood and if repeated repetative. One only needs to know why/where one exists (the existential theory) once â€“ one canÂ´t forget it because we are made to remember the very context in which we live (here an evolutionary bias helps us: when someone explains â€œwhat the world isâ€ we remember it because â€œwhat the world wasâ€ in caveman days was the most useful thing the brain could do â€“ in fact we evolved such large brains because bigger brains remember better (can moreso map social relationships, successfull or unsuccesfull learning-experiences). We want to climb upwards in the hierarchy, find a mate, etc but all these wants and needs would be useless (theyÂ´d having nothing to work on) if it werenÂ´t for the map (of social relationships etc) that our brain is capable of remembering. We are inclined to remember existential theories because such knowledge about our place in the context was as useful as mapping whom is married to whom. This bias, by the way, is something holy book writers used to get people interested in their book. â€œGod created earth in 6 days (not 5)â€ is memorable because of our bias toward wanting to know about â€œcreation of the worldâ€ â€“ so the number â€œ6 daysâ€ is remembered too because it adds to the map that we then work on to seek power and other evolutionary benefits. ItÂ´s hard to make plans that have one reach evolutionary benefits if one does not know oneÂ´s environment/the external world. â€œ6 days for creating this place/worldâ€ adds to oneÂ´s map of the environment/place/external world. We have a bias for remembering it. Too bad the bronze-age holy books used this marketing trick (â€œhey, letÂ´s say something about their world (like the creation of it) because that would be something they remember!â€) to give pseudo- existential theories. The holy books made sales because not only do people want information about their context, people also want God to talk and interfere with day-to-day personal activites. Once you have a pseudo-explanation for how/why the world was created, youÂ´re free to add to that pseudo-explanation that â€œthe creator talksâ€. ItÂ´s impossible to add such a talking thing to my existential theory â€“ not only is it unnecessary (my theory works stand-alone) but it also contradicts basically every concept of my existential theory. The very definitions of energymasspacetime (meaning that God had nothingness as the canvas to paint on â€“ a nothingness that needs energymass and summons it because of the laws of nature inherent in that nothingness â€“ and chose to paint a beginning with as-dense-as-can-be (just like E=mc2 wouldÂ´ve created it because E=mc2 is true in the smallest spaces). Where was God when this happened? CouldnÂ´t have been energymass because energymass is only summoned once the universe becomes pure nothingness. If God is not energymass and energymass is existence â€“ then God doesnÂ´t exist / God is nothing. What doesnÂ´t exist or is nothing doesnÂ´t give revalations to men, doesnÂ´t care whom you sleep with, etc. Is God or GodÂ´s heaven a location in our size of infinite spacetime? In that case God is simply a far-away alien (which warrants questions about its evolution) but again â€“ it doesnÂ´t talk to us because of the distance and we wouldnÂ´t be too impressed even if an evolved God did talk to us (we are quite like it â€“ our science is the same, our world-view is the same). God is not a location in a size but is God a size? The sizerange is infinite (as proven by distinction not being able to see antidistinction) and thatÂ´d mean that thereÂ´s a creator to God (and that thing too has a creator, ad infinitum) IN THE SAME WAY as humans built cities or atoms make molecules. Again, if God is a size it warrantÂ´s the question: is God every location of that size or is God, like humans, in a location of that size? Whatever be the case, God still couldnÂ´t communicate with us. Since God fits neither in the context of energymasspacetime nor the context of the sizerange, a God-theory absolutely contradicts the true theory. What is said about God â€“ that God is the greatest â€“ makes only one â€œlocationâ€/notion in the existential theory correspond to a non-talking uncaring God: the theory itself (and more precisely Reality/[that of which all is part]) is the greatest. It certainly doesnÂ´t hear/talk nor give revalations because it comes as an infinite sizerange of energymasspacetime. When you tell this science, you can get to the point where you define Reality as â€œthat of which all is partâ€ and the greatest â€“ you can even get to antidistinction/the unrepresentability of Reality (fully, because we do represent some things) and people might still hope that a talking God can exist. But as soon as you mention the less abstract (the more abstract was that [that of which all is part cannot be observed]), the God-theory either surrenders or is in conflict with a/the existential theory which certainly is true (anyone can verify how the components of the theory fit together, make sense and explain everything). God as a synonym for Reality is boring â€“ why do we even have two words if we mean the same (scientific sizerange) thing.
If you assume that God is a synonym for Reality (which comes as an infinite sizescale, which in turn predicts a DNA-strand somewhere and voila: everything is explained), then I believe in your God. It doesnÂ´t appriciate my appriciation of it though, nor do rituals, following rules (made by men) etc please it. If I am to â€œshow my appriciation to itâ€ I do it by writing as I do right now â€“ thatÂ´s my worship of it: but IÂ´m under no illusion that this writing would please God by being logical (eventhough Reality itself is logical too â€“ so we have something incommon) â€“ me writing can be called worship but the only appriciating recipients of my writing are me and readers of my text. Whatever I write about Reality/God doesnÂ´t please God (because God is not a thing that listens, likes worship by others and other human needs) â€“ whatever worshippers do, I hope they do it for themselves and for other humans because no-one else is able to care or comprehend the worship. I would do the muslim prayer if I felt that that kind of discipline would benefit me (and a few times I did get a good feeling from going to the mosque and being among worshippers). ItÂ´s so easy to adapt to the customs of oneÂ´s peers (and especially oneÂ´s superiors, if one believes that there are those) that my attitude toward worship/ritual is â€œwhen in Rome, do like the romans (if you or others gain something out of it)â€. The world is complex â€“ I could have the same attitude toward the beliefs of islam: that IÂ´ll just say that something is through eventhough it obviously isnÂ´t because it contradicts, say, a talking holy book-writing God. Could I make myself believe that something talkative is God? The belief disintegrates and I get the foul feeling of that IÂ´ve used my valuable memory to note down a lie everytime I would think just one step/association further from the belief itself. I can believe (in anything) but analyzing it even the smallest amount will make me disbelieve it. But when youÂ´re in the mood of not analyzing â€“ like when one is having a panic attack on oneÂ´s death-bed â€“ IÂ´ll be (extremely) simplistic and do what some people seem to always do: â€œbelieve (in something that breaks down when analyzed)â€. What confuses me is that some people believe all the time â€“ they seem perfectly sane but they believe in a talking, scripture-giving God (that doesnÂ´t fit anywhere in the existential theory). Do they need comfort (from untruth) all the time? It seems like theyÂ´re trying to argue their position, though. A perplexing phenomenon at first glance but when you consider that theyÂ´re uneducated about my existential theory, any theory will do (even a talking God-theory). I am not hateful of it when I see it in other people â€“ I see it as humorous/ridicilous â€“ but when it binds people together (to form what in essence is an army) and thereÂ´s many of them (10 000 religions/â€armiesâ€) the worldÂ´s got a problem. Binding people together through their shared scripture and their belief that something impossible is true is bad because groups tend to be more violent than individualists â€“ especially if their holy text 1) seems to bind billions of people to their army (morale-strength amplification in a group is the root of violence), and 2) preaches violence/disrespect (many holy books are xenophobic and eager to create an â€œus vs. themâ€-social dynamic). If the holy book is taken seriously (if it canÂ´t be thrown in the trash) then we have bronze-age xenophobia (based on who likes the book and who doesnÂ´t) creeping into the modern day, and we also have artificial bonding/loyalty â€“ we basically get groups who are hostile (or more disrespectful) toward anyone who doesnÂ´t see the point (â€œthereÂ´s a talking Godâ€) theyÂ´re promoting. ItÂ´s such an easily fixable problem: if you read my work you simply cannot believe in a talking God â€“ my professional role is that you can give me ANY individual and I can â€œconvertâ€ him/her into not believing in a talking God. Whether this person will follow his or her groupÂ´s rituals or codes of conduct, though, is up to them â€“ itÂ´s sheer peer pressure.
The â€œus vs. themâ€ â€œwe are a big groupâ€ (and especially) â€œwe should convert the whole world so that they use their precious memory for knowing nonsense like we doâ€ are such great reasons for violence â€“ and of course itÂ´s fixable because what these people lack is education: only where there is no theory, can a pseudo-theory take root. Only where there is no argument/debate/science can â€œGod talksâ€ seem like legitimate truth. This means that much of the worldÂ´s violence is due to a lack of education (about the big questions i.e. what I talk about). Sure: some religions can be interpreted to say â€œkill the infidelsâ€ or some other explicit declaration of war â€“ but itÂ´s hard for a religion to survive if it constantly preaces fighting (it must have more clever tactics than that â€“ but it does tend to seek world-dominion). IÂ´m not so worried that someone reads the Quran and thinks â€œIÂ´ll help the [unbelieves in the QuranÂ´s talking God] to get to hell faster, because the Quran says that thatÂ´s where they belongâ€. I am worried about that the Quran (or any holy book) is the glue that binds people together. Religion is the last glue before we enter an era where obviously arbitrary things like nationalism or language makes strangers feel more familiar with eachother. Nation and language arenÂ´t taken that seriously â€“ nor should religion be, but it is. This binding-effect that holy books have is what makes ISIS / the taliban etc so hard to defeat â€“ they think, not only that they have an all-seeing revalation-giving God on their side, but they also have the exact same copy of a book that a billion people have. They feel strong (with their, seemingly to them, superior numbers). Obviously ISIS underestimated the ability of the Quran to draw in arab nations into the fight over Iraq & Syria â€“ the modern world simply leaned on the fact that ISIS are not muslims because they interpret the bronze-age ramble wrong. But ISIS / the taliban is still a factor â€“ the quran binds too many people together in certain areas of the world â€“ violence is caused, due to the binding-effect, the â€œmoral superiorityâ€-effect, the â€œpower in numbers and billions of people read the Quranâ€-effect etc (all these effects are there even if you skip the parts about the talking God who word for word said the Quran) make men as prone to violence as anything can make them: theyÂ´re a group with an â€œus vs. themâ€ dogma & feeling and they feel like they have power in numbers. Add to that the frustration over having to finance an own home before one can ejaculate. Those circumstances can make the group take up arms and â€œsend the infidels where they belongâ€. Following the commandments frustrates, the whole notion of â€œletÂ´s all prioritize this text highest (our favorite book) so that weÂ´re bound togetherâ€ and that the text itself can be interpreted as violent all are a breeding-ground for trouble â€“ and when youÂ´re in the trouble that the text creates, you are not in the state of mind to do the internal debate necessary to disprove a talking God and thus make your whole way of life become something that you either do as meaningless fun or donÂ´t do because no-one cares. But just as some people want to become professional soccer players and some atheists do zen-meditation, humans (by personal preference) want hobbies, to take up a discipline, to do something that adds, say, pride to their life. I donÂ´t personally care about soccer and I donÂ´t feel pride from doing any ritual, but I can definitely see that others take the muslim prayers like an athlete takes their sport. ItÂ´s possible to find out the objective truth about whether these prayers â€œplease God or notâ€ (by, like IÂ´ve done in this text, disproving all kinds of false Gods and making the real God more mundane and not a talker). Rituals donÂ´t please Reality/â€the energymasspacetime sizerangeâ€ because it is not a thing that gets pleased â€“ itÂ´s like trying to please a rock. You do the prayers because you enjoy the pride/hobby for its own sake â€“ like someone doing sports likes his/her sport. Pleasing a rock/God to get to a â€œheavenâ€ (which too doesnÂ´t fit into the true existential theory) is stupid unless itÂ´s akin to a hobby/sport where you do it for doing itÂ´s sake. Same thing with the â€œheaven hates hamâ€-thing â€“ when you know enough science (enough = what IÂ´ve written so far in this text) youÂ´ll realize that the whole ham-prohibition is man-made (from the bronze age) and linked to some pre-scientific nonsense from-the-horseÂ´s-mouth-
statement (canÂ´t say rationale because itÂ´s dogma). If you (and secondarily your peers) are dedicated to nonsense (whether it be sports, stamp-collecting, memorizing capitals or not eating pork), then do it if it does something good like prove to yourself (and others) that you have a strong discipline (even though your effort is misdirected toward nonsense). I can invent a ritual and do it every day, and maybe IÂ´d feel pride over that I can keep to a schedule of nonsense, but I would never claim the theory that there is a talking God, and by extention I wouldnÂ´t say that that ficticious talker prohibited ham. The mundane action must be differentiated from the logical argument. Ham-prohibitions and talking Gods are artifacts that belong in the past â€“ modern white A4-paper is too beautiful for someone to write something as erroneous as â€œthere is a talking Godâ€ on it. But as IÂ´m writing this, people are dying because religion binds them together (and frustrates them, and boosts their war-morale in many ways). My work can cause a civil war within ISIS â€“ a civil rift so permiating that only family ties, friendships and common goals (to get money, not to spread islam) can keep people together in groups. Once my existential theory is known there will still be crime and instability in Iraq, Syria and Afghanistan, but the evil deeds will only be committed by groups of 2-3 people â€“ not 20 000 of them. The binding effect of the Quran can most clearly be seen in that internet-propaganda made Quran-readers from the USA and Europe go fight in Syria â€“ everyone wants a group and itÂ´s totally human to assume that knowing the same book will be enough for a bond to be as strong as one wants it to be.
Right now â€œmy workâ€ is 9 proper texts and a few videos. They all talk about the same thing (which can be formulated as: IÂ´ll say as much as I can about things IÂ´ve never heard anyone else say (and IÂ´ve seen the best professors in the world teaching truths)). To cause a rift in the taliban/ISIS and stop the war by making group-bonding (around a holy book) problematic/impossible, my whole â€œworkâ€ doesnÂ´t need to be dropped as propaganda books on top of ISIS and the taliban. ItÂ´s enough that the news headlines say that â€œa correct all-explaining existential theory has been found â€“ religions in crysisâ€ or that enough people know my theory so that a multitude of youtube videos are made where, in a sentence or two, the presenter goes off-topic and mentions why we exist / something from my theory. Having understood it once makes it impossible to forget â€“ having understood it once makes group-bonding over religion (which fuels ISIS/the taliban/etc) impossible. If the world could just take 20 minutes of itsÂ´ time to spend on explaining/teaching/arguing my work/theory, then the war on terror would be over â€“ otherwise it will persist as long as people have no actual, logical theory about their existence and thus believe in bronze-age marketing tricks.
â€”â€”-
The theory of evolution begins with the first reproducing shape. It was a shape that assembled surrounding mass into a similar shape. The existential theory predicts the existence of infinitely many such shapes. What inevitable becomes true when you have reproduction is that some die and some survive (life and death), that the number of offspring that shape make matters and that there is mutations over time. This is true about the shapeÂ´s offspring: some will die and some will survive, the number of offspring they make matters and the offspring can be different from the original shape. These three rules / laws of nature were inactive before the first reproduction occurred. The next main event was that one of these shapes found that if it injected its DNA into other shapesÂ´ reproductive mechanism, it exploited principle number two: that the number of offspring matters. It was the first virus: it hijacked othersÂ´ reproduction. The rule / law of nature that came into play with this event was that â€œpowerâ€ matters: hijacking othersÂ´ reproductive mechanism gives evolutionary benefits. Now weÂ´ve listed the four main rules that govern evolutionary theory: first came the three first, and then came the forth: power. The next main event â€“ to guard against viruses taking over all life / reproductive mechanisms â€“ was that an immune system evolved to protect against virusÂ´ hijack attempts. This required multicellularism. Just like immune systems prompt/require multicellularism, immune systems prompt/require multigenderedism: to win in the arms race against quickly mutating viruses two genders arose to amplify the mutations to the immune system. Mixing genes from two genders creates a more mutated immune system, which can keep ahead in the arms race against quickly-mutating viruses â€œtryingâ€ to mutate to bypass any immune system. The next main event is that one of these multicellular organisms â€“ a fish or worm â€“ of the male gender mutated to be agressive and defeat other males in battle. He wouldÂ´ve gotten access to many more females than his non-agressive counter-parts. This too can be called â€œpowerâ€ because the agressive male hijacks other maleÂ´s access to females by killing the males. This prompts the dinosaurs because larger muscle mass and shaper weaponry is better at killing off competitors. Amongst the dinosaurs there was the mother-offspring bond, placed there by evolution for the evolutionary benefits a mother gets from seeing an offspring survive to adulthood. This bond mutated to involve flock-members because a group working together out-competes any individualists when fighting over anything. The next main event was that someone mapped the flock, in his brain, as a hierarchy (up-down-axis) with the longing to dominate peers.

Dude, evolution has me try to maximize evolutionary benefits using my plans; im always thinking at full speed and pain drives that thinking. And i know for certain that all this pain is meaningless. Its a suicide recipe but what prevents me from suicide is the natural strength that stems from being the pinnacle of beasts who all have survived for generations.

New book 2017
Chapter 1:
What problem does this solve?
This solves a problem that becomes most visible 60 years from now when sea-levels rise, the economy goes into permanent decline and oil ends. ThatÂ´s when humans start to fight (and belong in world-view-based groups to do so). While the economy is still rising the clashes are few and far between â€“ Afghanistan, Syria, ISISÂ´ world-wide terror attacks (mainly muslim world-views clashing with tolerant world-views). When the economy starts declining thereÂ´ll naturally be more friction between groups, and groups are made up of world-views (people identify as in a group based on world-view).
Advancing the scientific world-view to the level where it explains our origin and thus invades religious intellectual turf, solves the problem of world-views colliding as war.
Chapter 2:
Certain truth â€“ I think & I am
You have a composite certain truth consisting of two certain truths: you can claim as certain that you think (because if you were being fooled: being fooled is thinking) and that you exist (because being fooled requires the one who is fooled to be there). I think and I exist is one statement but two truths. You can certainly claim to have â€œdistinctionâ€ because youÂ´re dealing with multiple separate distinct entities (such as â€œIâ€ and â€œthoughtâ€). One could put it, while seeing the certain truths â€œI thinkâ€ and â€œI existâ€, that the space between the two notions (thinker and thought) is the hallmark of distinction. The distance separating thinker from thought we can recognize as necessary for â€œdistinctionâ€ to be concluded as a certain truth arising, in a next logical step, from the original primary certain truth.
Everyone agrees they they themselves exist, because if one would get fooled in everyone one can be fooled in then one would exist there anyway and be fooled. So one knows that one exists. Then one also knows that one thinks because â€œto get fooledâ€ is a thought-process. Thus we have two things: I think and I exist. And the distinction between them: and on the flipside of the paper we have the opposite of that: anti-distinction, and this can also be called â€œthat of which all is partâ€/Reality. And since we are in the distinction-side of the paper when we see something; when we see something there is distinction between us and that thing. Thus we cannot represent or see that which is on the other side of the paper i.e. that of which all is part / Reality. Nothing can represent â€“ because it is distinct â€“ Reality. So whatever which is distinct cannotâ€¦ whatever that is observed or represented is distinct and therefore is notâ€¦ therefore does not represent Reality / â€œthat of which all is partâ€. So we have distinction and anti-distinction as opposing poles.
You have a certain truth which everyone in the whole world agrees upon. You think and you exist since if you were being fooled by an almighty demon youÂ´d still both think and exist. Then there are two things i.e. distinction. All is part of a single reality which is anti-distinction, there are no separate parts: reality is one. If we put distinction on the left side of the paper and anti-distinction on the right side then (we) distinction cannot see that of which all is part because â€œto seeâ€ is â€œto representâ€ and then one uses something to refer to reality. There is nothing outside reality which can refer to reality but instead reality is defined as â€œthat of which all is partâ€ and then there is nothing that can refer to all of reality. The opposition between the two sides of the paper (distinction & anti-distinction) makes reality as â€œthat of which all is partâ€-anti-distinction non-representable because representation always involves distinction. What we see, for example, is just parts of reality. The hypotheses can be infinitely much so there is infinitely much to reality. Sizes and times, that is. In the existential theory (â€œwhy we existâ€) there, thus, is an infinite size-range with time, energymass in spacetime (everything and nothing intertwined like in the E=mc2 equation â€“ energy equals mass times, well â€“ spacetime; multiplication is what unites energymass with spacetime). Then we have distinction and anti-distinction: separate things but all is part of a single reality. The existential theory with its three pillars, that is an infinite sizerange, energymasspacetime and distinction-anti-distinction-opposition, predicts that there should be a tiny piece of DNA which copies itself.
Then thereÂ´s another kind of revelation that got respect. Descartes who lived in the 1600s got respect, fame and was invited to live with the Queen of Sweden because he had gotten an idea which certainly told us something true. Revelations can either be con menÂ´s statements like they were from ape-man and forward, or they can actually claim something which is verifyably true. Descartes, propably having his mind overcrowded by the masses of revelations that had accumulated to his time, asked: â€œwhat would be true if all my statements were false?â€. What would remain if I tossed all my knowledge and ideas into the trash? Are we stuck with countless unverifyable statements, some contradicting eachother, not knowing which ones are true and which ones are not? Obviously not since statements about architecture are obviously true since they build houses, while contradictory statements do not. So Descartes dared to throw all his knowledge in the trash to see what remained. He found certain truth: that he exists â€“ because even if he was wrong or was being fooled in everything he thought to be true, thereÂ´d still be a â€œheâ€ there. He certainly exists no matter what. Same thing goes for thoughts: being wrong or being fooled is a thinking-process so even if he was wrong or was being fooled in everything he thought, thereÂ´d still be thought.
Socrates: So he figured out that he thinks and he exists.
God: These are not one statement â€“ they are two.
Socrates: What does that mean?
God: IÂ´ll tell you later â€“ just agree with me that there is distinction between thinker and thought â€“ that the statements are two. ItÂ´s building on certain truth, and itÂ´s possible to build a wholeâ€¦ whatever it is that â€œsaves the worldâ€ from the coming economic decline by having everyone build on certain truth until the God-debate is settled. Remembering â€œdistinctionâ€ (between thinker and thought) will prevent the horror-scenario of large-scale future wars between people group-bound by religions, and instead â€“ since everyone built a whole world-view on certain truth â€“ have a more stable decline in the future. â€œDistinctionâ€ i.e. remembering that there are two certain truths (thinker and thought) is a step on the way toward a plan that will save humanity from destroying itself as much as it would if we didnÂ´t build our world-views on certain truth.
Plato: So after an era of â€œrevelationâ€-revelations invented by anyone for whatever purpose, coming from DarwinÂ´s ape-manÂ´s revelations, Descartes, in the 1600s, invented a revelation â€“ certain truth: I think and I exist â€“ which got him invited to the Queen of Sweden for the rest of his life. People have always liked revelations and even verifyable truth-claims like DescartesÂ´ get respect.
God: I have set it as true that each one of you humans can verify in your own mindÂ´s eye that you do certainly exist and that there certainly is thought â€“ and thus there is distinction.
Darwin: Distinction is an abstract word. That two objects are separate/different from one another is one of those notions and ape-man never made into language â€“ there was never the evolutionary need to talk about â€œdistinctionâ€. Yes: one could say that one banana is different from another (and one wants the bigger one), but to have Distinction exist stand-alone as a distinct notion is abstract thinking and we are not evolved to do that. For millions of years the caveman word for â€œdistinctionâ€ was only used in a sentance â€“ not stand-alone as in â€œdistinction certainly exists because thinker and thought are both certain truthsâ€.
Chapter 3:
Distinction-antidistinction-opposition
The first proof for that the size-time-diagram is infinite is distinctionÂ´s (our) inability to see/represent anti-distinction.
Chapter 4:
Maximum size?
The second prooof for that the size-time-diagram is infinite is that if we imagine a partless anti-distinction then it has no distinction as in a â€œmaximumâ€ or â€œminimumâ€ size, i.e. the size-range is infinite.
Chapter 5:
Infinite size-time-diagram
Chapter 6:
Existential theoryÂ´s 3 pillars
Chapter 7:
Prediction of DNA

Everyone agrees on that reality is one. Because itÂ´s one nothing can represent it, because the representer too should be part of reality. That means that there is a size-time-diagram which is infinite. And thatÂ´s why we exist. Everyone agrees on this eventhough we are distinct unique individuals. We have this world-view incommon, with extraterrestrials too.

By being skeptical at every junction - every transition and every conclusion - you strengthen your belief in this ideology, resulting in a fuller dedication to the fact that your humannessÂ´ pinnacle is this course/sequence of thought. The more you are sceptic the more your religious and ideological conversion takes root, leading you to believe this is your highest level of humanness, then youÂ´ll be wanting to spread it to others because spreading it is free and it gives civilization to others. If you spread it theyÂ´ll share your painful meaninglessness and the joyous awe that comes from this. The ideology spreads because of what is said above, and once global itÂ´ll change the worldÂ´s emotional atmosphere to awe-inspiring meaninglessness from the various creator lordsÂ´ personalities that humans today have as religions. This is a civilizing-mission upon the world, ridding people of half-baked unscientific world-views and the emotions that come from seeing the big-picture wholistic summary of each individual world-view. The pinnacle of civilization - an atheistÂ´s God/reality - is meaningless but awe-inspiring and can be viewed and tattooed.
There are distinct things, separate entities - "distinction" is a legitimate word.
All things are part of "that of which all is part" aka. Reality; reality is one because you have never heard anyone say "yesterday I went to half of reality" or "I just came back from two realities to this one". Look up "reality" in the dictionary and you should find that it is "the one of which all is part" - it is not plural (youÂ´ll never hear someone talk about realities).
By being one it can be called "anti-distinction" because distinction means many. All distinction (all distinct objects) are part of reality/anti-distinction/one.
Representation can occur as eyes/neurons mapping objects, as money mapping objects that can be purchased or as anything spontaneously standing as a symbol for anything else. Regardless of brains being involved, a coffee cup - in the eyes of God - represents all of the known cosmos; "represents" is infinitely vaguely defined meaning anything represents anything. Yet all representation is distinction because it takes two to tango: representer and representee. By all representation being distinction, can representation represent anti-distinction? No, the two are opposites. Yet we do represent anti-distinction by talking about it; we do see our everyday life experience even though we said that anti-distinction/reality cannot be seen because of the opposition between distinction (all representation is distinction) and anti-distinction/"that of which all is part - one reality"). We do represent/see something but not all of anti-distinction; we see something but not everything; there is more to reality
than can be represented. Are there any limits to representation if "represents" is infinitely vaguely defined in the eyes of God? We can hypothesize infinitely much and yet anti-distinction (as a whole) would remain unrepresented. Reality is thus infinite and we always map less than all of it, regardless of the infinitely vague definition of "represents".
The opposition between distinction (representation) and anti-distinction (reality) that leads to the conclusion that reality is infinite can be drawn as two dots representing distinction on one side of a line and letting the other side of the line represent the invisible anti-distinction either by us not drawing anything there or perhaps drawing one dot to say that reality is one.
What is reality infinite in/as? E=mc2 teaches us that energymass (E=m) and spacetime (c2, because c is a distance over time) are together. This warrants the (single) word energymasspacetime. All objects have a size in space, a coordinate in space and a time, and they are made of energymass. Reality is infinite energymasspacetime. Energymass is a synonym for existence and spacetime is a synonym for non-existence. Just like in "every action has an equal and opposite reaction", spacetime cancels/balances energymassÂ´ existence.
That reality/energymasspacetime is infinite can be diagrammed as a size-time-diagram with infinity symbols in each of the four corners. Size is infinite toward the small and toward the large, and at each size you have an infinity of time (because spacetime is one thing and weÂ´ve proven that it (reality) is infinite).
That energymass exists because it exists in spacetime/non-existence is captured in the equation E=mc2
Our existential theory thus is "an infinite size-time diagram made of energymasspactime and distinction-anti-distinction-opposition" or "energymasspacetime as infinite size-time and distinction-anti-distinction-opposition" or "distinction-anti-distinction-opposition as an infinite size-time diagram made out of energymasspacetime".
It, in its awe-inspiring meaningless fashion, replaces God with itself - promoting atheism (atheists agree that reality exists and can call reality "God"). ItÂ´s obvious that an infinite energymasspacetime size-range does not, like the Quran claims, author books that prohibit pork; reality is not of an authorship nature.
The largest knowable for any planet is cosmology and the likewise smallest is quantum physics - humans exist as large compared to the smallest knowable as we are small compared to the largest knowable; we are in the middle of the knowable size-range. Evolution begins in our region of the size-range. The existential theoryÂ´s infinite size-range predicts that there should be a size where reproduction occurs - where a mass assembles surrounding mass into a similar shape.
Evolution begins simple and builds upon previous steps to become more complex over time, which is why it is diagrammed as triangle-shaped. The tip of the triangle meets the square size-time-diagram in the middle of the size-axis because thatÂ´s the size where evolution occurs. The rest of the triangle is floating in the 3
rd
dimension as to represent complexity instead of change in size.
You know for certain that you think and that you exist because even if an almighty demon was fooling you in everything you can possibly be fooled in, the fooling itself is a thought-process and therefore you know that thought exists (you think), and for you to be fooled you have to exist and therefore you know "I exist". Being fooled is thinking and a thinker is necessary for there to be someone to be fooled. So you know: no matter what, you think and you exist. Those are two things, right? TheyÂ´re both part of the same brain and the thought-process can become the analytical toolkit/thinker, but still we recognize that there are distinct entities - there is distinction. This can also be called separation. What is distinctionÂ´s opposite, anti-distinction? ItÂ´s one reality; that of which all is part; itÂ´s one and realityÂ´s definition in the dictionary is that all is part of it. If we write distinction (thinker and thought) on the left side of the paper and anti-distinction (reality; that of which all is part; one) on the right side of the paper - can the left side see the right side? No, because of opposition between distinction and anti-distinction. Because of there always being an observer (a thinker) and thus distinction in every observation and thus anti-distinction canÂ´t be represented/seen.
The brain evolved to deal with natural
occurrences
- there was never an event in history where something invisible was to be contemplated and dealt with. Thus we seem to assume that the thought-process went wrong when we say that distinction/us canÂ´t see anti-distinction/reality. But the thought-process didnÂ´t go wrong: all that it means is that there is more to reality than can be represented. Regardless of how vaguely "represents" is defined, say a coffee cup - regardless of brains being involved - is assumed to try to represent that of
which all is part, then anti-di
stinction - distinction - opposition (the opposition between distinction and itÂ´s opposite) makes the representation incorrect. We can ask if there in an anti-distinct "thing" is a maximum size and thus distinction? No. Likewise, another proof for that the size-range is infinite is that we do sense something (our everyday world) and can make hypotheses ad infinitum, and yet nothing represent
s ALL OF reality. Reality i.e. s
ize-time thus is infinite.
The infinite size-range is one
foundational idea
in the existential theory. Another
foundational idea
is energymass and spacetime being opposites but intertwined as in E=mc
2
(where c
2
refers to a speed which is space over time: spacetime). Multiplication joins energymass together with spacetime; nothing together with something/everything; existence together with non-existence. Why is there existence the shape of my body? Without going into the historical answer, one can explain it by saying that the body is something in (intertwined with) nothing, of a size in an infinite size-range (where the relationship between any two sizes (or objects of two sizes) i
s that they make sense of i.e. j
ustify one another). Then there too, as a third
foundational idea
, is distinction-an
ti-distinction-opposition i.e. w
e live in a single (not plural) reality but we see distinct/separate entities such as thinker and thought.
Speaking of spacetime, spacetime is the logical starting point for the time-based existential theory.
Nothingness (empty space) needs n
o prior justification nor reason to exist, because it doesnÂ´t exist. In it, however
, laws of nature are true i.e. i
t is not irrational / anti-logical, and among the many laws of nature there are those, including E=mc
2
, which mention energymass. Could energymass be "mentioned" without it existing? If yes, it would be absurd / anti-logical. Why would reality mention things that never exist? But since laws of nature are firm and because of our rule "what is mentioned must exist or must be summoned" we get, wherever (in the smallest spaces) that E=mc
2
is mentioned, existence and thus dense existence: a big bang.
All of the above is a rival theory to "God created earth in 6 days and rested on the 7th". It is unintuitive because it deals with things we didnÂ´t have to deal with in evolution: invisible energymasspacetime/reality/anti-distinction as a part of reasoning. It also has a multi-reason cause for our existence:
a
big bang combined with a 3-
foundational idea
existential theory which justifies size and energymass. It is abstract/scientific but canÂ´t be reduced into simpler terms. ItÂ´s the lowest common denominator that everyone can believe in (regardless of religion).
How many is reality?
How many is Allah? One. Can anything completely represent reality?
Can anything completely represent Allah? No. Is reality the greatest (if all is part of it)?
Is â€œAllah akbarâ€? Yes. Reality and Allah have these three things
in common.
Atheists agree that reality exists but an infinite sizerange of energymasspacetime and distinction-anti-distinction-opposition does not write books to prohibit pork.
How vaguely has reality defined â€to representâ€?
Infinitely vaguely â€“ anything can represent anything.
Is the representation/representer reality or Allah?
No.
Can anything represent that of which all is part?
No.
Then the size-time-diagram is infinite i.e. nothing represents reality. How many is it? How many is Allah? 1.
Did it sayâ€¦, or did it wri
te a book?
This disproves Allah writing the Quran.
Again: how much of reality can be represented by, say, a painting? The whole of it?
No, the whole of reality cannot be represented. Just like Allah canÂ´t be captured in a picture/word.
We can have hypotheses â€“ how many hypotheses can we have?
If reality is sizes & times, energymass and spacetime then the square-shaped size-time-diagram with energymasspacetime in each coordinate is the universal way to represent all there is to represent.
Does it write books? No, it is not of such authorship-kind nature.
â€œGod said to Muhammed word by wordâ€¦â€ is thus a false or at most metaphorical statement.
â€œYou have to do rituals in order not to go to hell, and in heaven you get 72 virginsâ€ is by the same logic also a false claim.
There are three alternatives as the foundation for this logic â€“ can you think of a 4
th
one?
1: Reality is a synonym for Allah
(and is more accurately â€œan infinite energymasspacetime size-range of distinction-anti-distinctionâ€
)
2: or Allah doesnÂ´t exist
3: or there are 72 virgins (not an alternative because reality is not of the nature, because it is size-time-energymasspacetime, to write books).
This, if read by terrorists, would make it impossible to remain terrorist.
In addition to the square size-time diagram with infinity symbols in each of itÂ´s corners, and the evolutionary triangle which designates that life becomes more complex as time goes on (the triangle originates at the central size of the known size-range), there is the following brain diagram:
You have a composite certain truth consisting of two certain truths: you can claim as certain that you think (because if you were being fooled: being fooled is thinking) and that you exist
(because being fooled requires the one who is fooled to be there). I think and I exist is one statement but two truths. You can certainly claim to have â€œdistinctionâ€ because youÂ´re dealing with multiple separate distinct entities (such as â€œIâ€ and â€œthoughtâ€). One could put it, while seeing the certain truths â€œI thinkâ€ and â€œI existâ€, that the space between the two notions (thinker and thought) is the hallmark of distinction. The distance separating thinker from thought we can recognize as necessary for â€œdistinctionâ€ to be concluded as a certain truth arising, in a next logical step, from the original primary certain truth.
Are all distinct entities part of a single reality if â€œrealityâ€ is defined as â€œthat of which all is partâ€? In other words: if we draw distinction on the left side of a paper and anti-distinction (distinctionÂ´s opposite: a singular reality â€“ that of which all is part. Zooming out summarizing maximally) on the right side of the paper, then can distinction represent the right side of the paper i.e. anti-distinction? How could some distinct entities depict the very opposite of what representation/distinction is? Any depiction/representation of anti-distinction/reality has at least three entities: thinker, space between thinker and thought, and thought. Separation/distinction is inherent in representation, thus anti-distinction is unrepresentable.
How vaguely has the universe/God defined what a representation is i.e. when a representation occurs? Our brains use neurons to represent, but what if â€“ instead of neurons (regardless of brains) â€“ the universe wills that any random object can be said to, as neurons do, represent reality? The universe has defined â€œrepresentationâ€ infinitely vaguely i.e. disregarding brains, any random object spontaneously is the symbol standing for all of reality â€“ because the universe defines â€œrepresentsâ€ infinitely vaguely. Despite the infinitely vague definition of what represents what, distinction-anti-distinction-opposition (the line separating the left side of the paper from the right side; the countering of distinction with anti-distinction) means that reality is not representable. If reality is anti-distinction then no distinction (representation is inherently distinction) can even, despite an infinitely vague definition of â€œrepresentsâ€, capture reality.
In
representations we can count at least three things and what weÂ´re trying to capture is one thing with nothing outside it. The fact that representations contain distinction makes capturing reality (all is one) impossible.
We can have infinitely many or infinitely large/substancefull representations/hypotheses â€“ such as an infinite size-time-diagram â€“ and though abstractly accurately pointing to reality, the universeÂ´s rule that nothing represents reality despite infinitely vaguely allowed representations of infinitely much, makes reality unrepresentable. This can only mean one thing: reality â€“ which we know as sizes and times (a size-time-diagram) â€“ is infinite. ThereÂ´s infinitely large and infinitely small with infinitely much past and infinitely much future. This square-shaped size-time-diagram i.e. our everyday experience of size-time has infinities all-over the place.
Energymass in spacetime: one in zero, existence in non-existence, something in nothing â€“ as defined by E=mc
2
where c
2
stands for speed (distance over time i.e. spacetime/zero/non-existence) and E=m referring to energymass (existence, something, all).
Distinction-anti-distinction-opposition: we live in a singular reality but we see multiple objects.
An infinite size-range.
The above three ideas are an existential theory (a theory which explains the existence of a reproducing shape and thus the dawn of evolution and thus our existence). It is modern to utilize three equal ideas to explain oneÂ´s existence â€“ all previous existential theories used
either a single idea (monotheism) or a saga (multiple mundane (not very scientific/abstract) ideas) to explain existence.
The predictive quality that makes this existential theory a scientific theory is that it, basing it off an infinite size-range of energymasspacetime and distinction-anti-distinction-opposition, predicts that in an infinite size-range there ought to be a size where reproduction occurs. The existential theory predicts the first DNA, and from there we get to the evolutionary theory.
The theory of evolution begins with the first reproducing shape. It was a shape that assembled surrounding mass into a similar shape. The existential theory predicts the existence of infinitely many such shapes. What inevitable becomes true when you have reproduction is that some die and some survive (life and death), that the number of offspring that shape make matters and that there is mutations over time. This is true about the shapeÂ´s offspring: some will die and some will survive, the number of offspring they make matters and the offspring can be different from the original shape. These three rules / laws of nature were inactive before the first reproduction occurred. The next main event was that one of these shapes found that if it injected its DNA into other shapesÂ´ reproductive mechanism, it exploited principle number two: that the number of offspring matters. It was the first virus: it hijacked othersÂ´ reproduction. The rule / law of nature that came into play with this event was that "power" matters: hijacking othersÂ´ reproductive mechanism gives evolutionary benefits. Now weÂ´ve listed the four main rules that govern evolutionary theory: first came the three first, and then came the forth: power. The next main event - to guard against viruses taking over all life / reproductive mechanisms - was that an immune system evolved to protect against virusÂ´ hijack attempts. This required multicellularism. Just like immune systems prompt/require multicellularism, immune systems prompt/require multigenderedism: to win in the arms race against quickly mutating viruses two genders arose to amplify the mutations to the immune system. Mixing genes from two genders creates a more mutated immune system, which can keep ahead in the arms race against quickly-mutating viruses "trying" to mutate to bypass any immune system. The next main event is that one of these multicellular organisms - a fish or worm - of the male gender mutated to be ag
g
ressive and defeat other males in battle. He wouldÂ´ve gotten access to many more females than his non-ag
g
ressive counter-parts. This too can be called "power" because the ag
g
ressive male hijacks other maleÂ´s access to females by killing the males. This prompts the dinosaurs because larger muscle mass and shaper weaponry is better at killing off competitors. Amongst the dinosaurs there was the mother-offspring bond, placed there by evolution for the evolutionary benefits a mother gets from seeing an offspring survive to adulthood. This bond mutated to involve flock-members because a group working together out-competes any individualists when fighting over anything. The next main event was that someone mapped the flock, in his brain, as a hierarchy (up-down-axis) with the longing to
be the top of the hierarchy. This capitalist striving for
the top made brains grew larger â€“ larger memory-banks, more accurate predictions and faster planning are all advantages coming from a larger cortex.
****
*
Power lead men to accumulate resources â€“ the very resources females needed for their children. Females care most about their children because they pass on their genes, so in finding a male they aim for loyalty plus status/power/placement in the hierarchy. Females think a lot about how others â€“ especially suitors â€“ perceive them and therefore males evolved the subconscious mechanism, to
keep womenâ€™sÂ´ attention, to push-pull i.e. to, in one coherent fluent conversation, both say negative feedback about the woman and positive feedback.
* We are trying to impress the â€œhierarchical topâ€ i.e. the god or king just like kids try to impress their parents. Since powerhungriness is infinite, the hierarchical top is infinitely far away and weÂ´re trying to impress it to gain resources/rewards and climb upwards.
It is a major historical event that there finally is an atheistic argument that is sh
aped like a university course: i
t is an existential theory plus evolution which not only doesnÂ´t need a personified god to function, but the
foundational idea
s (infinite sizerange of energymasspacetime and distinction-anti-distinction-opposition) canÂ´t have a personified god added to them as a 4th
foundational idea
without the theory sounding
ridiculous
. Not only does the theory not need a personified god but adding a god destroys the minimalistic rationally complete beauty of the theory. Gods uglify the theory. The dawn of the theory is a major historical event because never before has an entire course (beginning with certain truth, going through the existential theory and ending in evolution) been laid out in the intellectual debate of atheism, as an argument against a personified god.
This is argument against both theism and deism.
The anatomy in the brain from hearing certain truth (I think & I am) - the beginning of the course - creates the same neuronal pathways / associations between ideas in every single person who knows certain truth. The logical step to "distinction" is noting, as a meta-analysis of the primary certain truth, that one has many ideas (I think AND I am) and that one can take logical pathways to the next step in the course (distinction exists). Then juxtaposing anti-distinction with distinction creates the unseeable - "defying reason" (because reason is, in simple people, only visual) - conclusion that we/distinction cannot see reality/anti-distinction. The distinction-anti-distinction-opposition is hard to grasp because it - like formal logic or math - uses words instead of pictures (the linguistic brainhalf rather than the visual one). We evolved to be like "if I see it I believe it" and that was a good heuristic (rule of thumb) because practical sequences of events can be verified as true or untrue by visualizing them. But in this philosophy: no - it has to be linguistic that we deny ourselves the concept "all of reality", leading to the conclusion that there is more to reality than anything - however vaguely the universe has defined "represent" - can represent. This adds infinitely many sizes to our abstract size-range / size-time-diagram; it makes a square (with size on the y-axis and time on the x-axis) with infinity symbols in each corner, which in turn becomes a
foundational idea
in our personified-god-denying existential theory.
To come from certain truth, through mere logical steps (meta-analyses and juxtaposition of opposites), to an existential theory which predicts evolution is a major historical event in the history of atheism.
Thinker & thought leading to distinction leading to anti-distinction leading to that anti-distinction canâ€™t be represented leading to the foundational ideas of the existential theory, is the path of logic everyone should know.
It makes believing in God impossible.
I wrote a text which needs to reach terrorists because the text makes religious jihad something impossible to engage in. My message is a sequence of logic whichÂ´s conclusion is more knowledge about the God-topic â€“ which is a topic that engages religious terrorism.
Understanding this makes religious terrorism impossible to engage in.
As we go through the diagram, ask yourself at every step of the way: â€œwhat would aliens think?â€ i.e. is the diagram based on universal truths.
This part of the diagram is two sides separated by a line. On the left side we have distinction â€“ separate entities represented by two dots. LetÂ´s let the two dots be what we certainly know exists: thinker and thought. On the right side of the line I havenÂ´t drawn anything because the right side represents anti-distinction (reality; that of which all is part). If one were to draw something it ought to be one dot because reality/anti-distinction is one. But because it canÂ´t be represented (fully) due to distinction-anti-distinction-opposition it is more proper to leave it undrawn. There is however a right side.
Energymass (existence) and spacetime (non-existence) intertwined as in E=mc
2
allows for the word energymasspacetime. The two are opposites (part of realityÂ´s balance) and intertwined.
The size-axis, proven to be infinite by distinction-anti-distinction-opposition i.e. that the universe has defined â€œrepresentsâ€ infinitely vaguely and we do represent something with our words/eyes/etc. and yet nothing represents anti-distinction/reality because in every representation there is distinction.
The time-axis, proven to be infinite by the fact that space/size and time are one and the same spacetime.
The evolutionary triangle, triangle-shaped because evolution gets more complex over time. Originates in the middle of the known size-axis.
The brain, resulting from evolution.
The core of the self/brain is a cluster of cells which are constantly (except in sleep) activating the emotional repertoireÂ´s circuits. The emotions then activate a cortical plan which exists across the linguistic and visual brainhalves. The reason the function of having two brainhalves evolved is because the visual brainhalf can create sequences of imagined or remembered events and if the outcome of that sequence rewards the emotional repertoireÂ´s circuits, that plan is remembered/pursued. WhatÂ´s imaginable is possible/right/true and this makes the anti-distinction-part of this science something where people lose the thread.
See the diagram as a self-portrait: it has the current events in the brain, it has all of evolutionary past in the triangle and it has the existential context.
In a historical context the anatomy (neural connections between ideas and sequences of logic) created by this course is like a paradigm-shift into a new era of earth society - an era similar to that existent on infinitely many other planets who have come further than our midway-mark in a regular water-bearing planetÂ´s history.
Evolution, by beginning with "a mass that can assemble surrounding mass into a similar shape" steps forth from the existential theoryÂ´s infinite size-range of energymasspacetime. Assuming DNA is the replication-molecule, we can step - skipping over how cell walls evolved etc - to the fact that viruses mutate to hijack othersÂ´ reproductive system. This - in this universal inter-planetary extraterrestrial culture - is formulated, in books of logic, as first three rules arising (life/death, number of offspring matters and "there is mutation in each generation-shift") and then a forth rule arising (power, with viruses). This story - which in our course begins from a first reproducing shape and ends with finessing the anatomy of power in men - is visualizable like the caveman story-telling narratives we evolved to hear/see. We can proof-check its validity/possibility by following the narrative visually. The visual nature of evolution is in stark contrast to the purely linguistic/abstract nature of the existential theory.
Speaking o
f "abstract" descriptions i.e. d
escriptions that make it very clear to us that our understanding of the universe is a mere map (a reference) and not reality itself (mind you of PlatoÂ´s or KantÂ´s cave-metaphor and "the thing is not the thing itself" -philosophies)... The size-range of energymasspacetime,
at the size of quantum physics
has us describe photons etc using both the wave-description which focu
s
es on lengths of space (this is the "spacetime description") AND - in wave-particle duality - the energymass description that the energy of a photon is its color. Color (as perceived through the eyes), wave/spacetime-description and particle-energy/energymass-description all are valid descriptors of quantum particles. This ability of ours to describe any mass/phenomenon using both energymass- and spacetime-
descriptions runs throughout the entire size-range. You can imagine two lines - one representing energymass and the other representing spacetime - running vertically through the pictures on the size-axis. Adding complexity to this, there is likewise two lines - gravity and electromagnetism - both running through the size-axis, gravity having itÂ´s duality of energymass and spacetime descriptions and electromagnetism too having both, in every level of the size-range, energymass and spacetime descriptions. Gravity is both Newtonian "masses pulling toward masses" (energymassÂ´ focus on mass) and Einsteinian "curvature of spacetime" (spacetimeÂ´s focus on space) - both descriptors are accurate.
From having read this book, the following should now be understandable:
Certain truth leads to the conclusion â€œdistinctionâ€, and simultaneously warrants an anti-distinction defined as â€œthat of which all is partâ€. The opposition between distinction and anti-distinction â€“ despite â€œrepresentationâ€ being ubiquitous (infinitely vaguely defined) â€“ together with the â€œmax size?â€-question asked in anti-distinction â€“ supports the fact that reality i.e. size-time is infinite. This then becomes our
foundational idea
in our existential theory that moves God away from a creator role. The two other
foundational idea
s are energy
masspacetime (found in E=mc
2
) and the opposition that we live in a singular reality yet see multiple things. From the middle of the known size-range (which itself is part of the infinite size-range) comes the tip of a triangle which symbolizes evolution. From evolution, then, comes the brain diagram with dopamine & serotonin across the visual and linguistic brainhalves, and a lower box which is our 3-category emotional repertoire; the most common 4 emotions in our idle society being power-hungryness (how to elevate oneself in the socioeconomic hierarchy if one is a man; and for females itÂ´s mapping the status-hierarchy of men in their social group as to find them differently attractive), expanding oneÂ´s world-view, planning sex and planning resource-gathering/work. This makes for a multi-symbol diagram involving the existential theoryÂ´s three
foundational idea
s holding up the square-triangle-brain (size-time-diagram, evolution, brain) diagram.
Certain truth is or leads to distinction, which itself â€“ as all distinct things are â€“ is part of anti-distinction. This is like saying obvious things about the reality/everyday world in front of us: such as that size is infinite and that it is something in nothing. All this, in turn, leads us to draw a square: a size-time diagram with infinity-symbols in all 4 corners. From the middle of the known size-range, then, comes a triangle â€“ evolution â€“ which ends
up in the brain with serotonin, dopamine, two brainhalves, a cortex and an emotional repertoire (upper- and lower box). In the emotional repertoire there are 4 idle emotions, among them â€œseeking powerâ€ â€“ power here is defined as outcompeting other males (if oneself is male) in a status competition, but the principle of diminishing other malesÂ´ reproductive capabilities happened at several stages in evolution: males fighting males (growing bigger to become dinosaurs) or viruses hijacking reproductive mechanisms of single-celled organisms. The search for power thus has led to brain-size growing (when competing for upwardness in hierarchies) but also things like T-rexÂ´s claws or the 1918 flu â€“ not to mention war.
You know for certain that you think and that you exist because in the event that you were being fooled (or threw all your knowledge in the trash) you would "think" because being fooled is a thinking-process and you would exist because "being fooled" implies that there is someone there who is being fooled.
There is distinction between thinker and thought. There are separate entities. "Distinction" is one logical step from certain truth.
All is part of a single reality - "all as one" is anti-distinction (the opposite of distinction).
Can thinker or thought see anti-distinction? Can distinction represent anti-distinction? The opposites cannot catch one another.
Is there thus distinction in the form of a maximum or minimum size (or time) in anti-distinction? No, therefore size and time are infinite.
Another proof for that the size-range is infinite is that the universe defined "represents" infinitely vaguely, meaning that this text - in the eyes of God - is attempting to represent "that of which all is part"/reality as one, but fails because representation is distinction and reality is anti-distinction.
At every size you see energymass (existence) and spacetime (non-existence) as intertwined, as in E=mc
2
(where c
2
is spacetime). Because E=mc
2
is true in every size (including the smallest ones) the Big Bang gets summoned as dense when there is nothingness. Telescope observations show that nothingness is coming in the future again.
An infinite size-range of energymasspacetime and distinction-anti-distinction explains our existence better than God.
The square in the diagram is a size-time-diagram with size on the up-down-axis and time on the horizontal axis (because it is universal to the history of science to discover the large and small by looking up and down respectively). The size-range is represented again under the square as ten lines stacked on top of one another. Human bodies are approximately as large compared to the smallest known as humans are small compared to the largest known, meaning weÂ´re in the middle of the known size-range. The ten-lines-on-top-of-one-another size-range is one out of three
foundational ideas which holds up the upper part of the diagram. An infinite size-range is one of three fundamental ideas in an existential theory and the upper part of the diagram with its square size-time-diagram and triangular evolution is the symbol for the cause of our existence, and it is connected to the three
foundational ideas that explain why there is evolution in the first place.
Previous atheists have moved God from a place where do intervenes in everyday life using miracles, to a God that set everything in motion but then doesnÂ´t intervene. My philosophy places God as a bum who watches a skyscraper get built â€“ the bum then gets praised for the skyscraper getting built even though the bum didnÂ´t contribute anything: at most he watched
as other mechanisms got everything done. Or God is a football fan who cheers at the players but doesnÂ´t himself contribute to making goals. Natural mechanisms create the world â€“ no need to praise God.
We are half-way in a planetÂ´s history â€“ 4.5 billion years have passed and 5 billion remain. The theory you now know is, in other words, in cosmic majority â€“ more planets have it than not (if it takes approximately half of a planetÂ´s history to invent it and if it remains true for the rest of the planetÂ´s history). Most other planets i.e. the majority of extraterrestrials are ideological adherents of the theory. Spread this theory to get approval of the majority even though it lives light-years away. Currently 99.9% of the worldÂ´s population lives in the era of religions â€“ spread this theory to end religious wars and terrorism like 9/11. The world-view (the view/diagrams that explain the world) is the same in the cosmic majority.
IÂ´ve worked 10 years to invent this theory and as alone bearing it itÂ´s my responsibility that it spreads. The future civilization in which everyone has the same world-view thus is dependent on me. I feel a
unique ability to influence earthÂ´s future.
You, as one who has partaken of this rare knowledge, should also feel a responsibility about spreading it to change the world.
To scepticts I teach that:
You begin with certain truth. What can you know certainly? LetÂ´s move from there through small logical steps until weÂ´ve reached a new world-view / new knowledge about God. You know for certain that you think and that you exist because if an almighty demon would be fooling you in everything you can be fooled in, youÂ´d still be thinking because "being fooled"
is a thinking process and there has to be somebody for that someone to be fooled. "I think and I exist". The small logical step from there is just noting that there are multiple entities, separate things, distinction itself. The next logical step is asking whatÂ´s distinctionÂ´s opposite i.e. That of which everything is part - we ask this because itÂ´s the antithesis of distinction and all distinct entities are obviously part of one whole called reality. Anti-distinction and all distinction are the two faces of reality; the flipsides of the coin called reality. Reality comes as both an invisible anti-distinct whole (which is invisible because representation is distinction so representation cannot catch anti-distinction) and as distinction. The next logical step is asking whether reality is infinite in size-time: is there a max or min size in anti-distinction? No, because a maximum would be a distinction. Representation can catch infinitely much but still distinction-anti-distinction-opposition makes reality unrepresentable, hence even though we say that whatever represents infinities in size and time reality remains larger than that. This infinite sizerange then becomes one of the pillars in our existential theory, along with the face that there is distinction (separate things; our everyday world) because of its opposite anti-distinction - and vice versa (there is anti-distinction because there is our distinct everyday world), and energymass and spacetime too cancel, balance and exist due to one another. An energymasspacetime sizerange of distinction-anti-distinction did not write a book (like the Quran claims) because it is not of an authorship-kind nature. This defeats both theist and deist notions of a God which is not simply a synonym for nature/reality. In other words: the only definition for God is that it is a synonym for reality (an energymasspactime sizerange of distinction-anti-distinction). Furthermore this truth brings meaninglessness. As a wholistic summary world-view this doesnÂ´t freighten, make violent nor motivate like religious world-views did. This true world-view is awe-inspiring meaninglessness, overwhelming abstract pointlessness.
My ideology - my replacement for religion - arises from losing a creator lord (God). 90% of people today believe in God. I watch them and see a mismatch between the meaningless awe-inspiring correct atheistic world-view and their imaginary creator whether he be loving, jealous, frightening or violence-spurring. The feeling one gets from oneÂ´s overall summary world-view is what people call God. I can prove that awe-inspiring meaninglessness is the correct feeling to be gotten from the overarching world-view. I can prove that the atheistic world-view is the correct one - atheists do believe that reality exists and may use "God" as a synonym for reality/nature. I dispute the theistic and deistic world-views where God either set the universe in motion as a first cause or where God intervenes in everyday life using miracles - both such views are wrong. The existential theory science has made answers the questions of 1) why there is a size where evolution occurs, 2) why there is something (rather than just nothing), and 3) why there is our everyday world of separate objects. Those three points taken together - as unintuitive as it seems - are the foundation on which the true world-view, and here I mean world view as in a view that explains the world, is as a diagram.
By being a sequence of thought much like a school course it can be entered at different points, rewound and analyzed/been skeptical towards, and if so done it strengthens the belief that it is the pinnacle of human thinking. Thinking is what makes us human and since this ideology is a sequence of thought it is spontaneously prioritized by the brain as the pinnacle world-view, the essence of humanness.
IÂ´ve talked about the emotional repertoire in the brain-diagram. If we were to genetically engineer (DNA-manipulate) a next generation, we would A) give it an incredible sense of humor and knowledge so it could entertain us, and/or B) make it a super-happy retard â€“ retarded because positive emotions donÂ´t motivate â€“ they pacify â€“ so super-happy is equal to looking like a mongoloid; needs and wants and everything that drives us is painful â€“ pain motivates while super-happiness pacifies. We would, by creating these DNA-engineered emotional repertoires (to accomplish the dual goal of incredible happiness and incredible entertainers/comedians/philosophers), be doing something that is done on other planets â€“ these are universal engineering goals.
You know that gold plate we sent up into space for aliens to find? It had etched on it images of man, some music, some other picturesâ€¦ We didnÂ´t send up the diagram discussed in this book. If the aliens see the gold plate we did send up, theyÂ´ll read between the lines â€“ seeing that there is no universal diagram â€“ and conclude that: â€œon earth they still believe in godsâ€.
You know how most people dedicate a large part of their lives to religion? Once they understand my tattoo (diagram) theyÂ´ll ask themselves: â€œwhat the hell have I been praying to?â€ It resembles a tiny needle popping a big balloon.
If this book goes mainstream, the future becomes so interesting that one forgets oneÂ´s everyday problems.
Interesting important things relieve
anxiety
(especially when they contain humor like a universal tattoo).
Nazis were friends with Nazis, communists were friends with communists, USA was friends with USA, when jihadists meet they share the same ideology and thus bond quickly. My theory/ideology/religion-replacer is empathy-increasing.
The more things people agree upon the better.
In the diagram/tattoo there are about 16 â€œlinesâ€ (hundreds if we consider the emotional repertoire being drawn the same on other planets). The sport is to draw as many universal lines as possible â€“ drawn from science so they can be drawn from science anywhere in the infinite universe.
God is a war-motivator. They say â€œthere are no atheists in trenchholesâ€. You need a bit of God to do war.
ItÂ´s hard to be an atheist warrior. My book, by disproving god, thus makes motivation for war less.
Gods contribute nothing â€“ one will have the full human experience-repertoire without gods.
But religiousness makes you healthier even though itÂ´s provably wrong. ItÂ´s what youÂ´d expect from wish-thinking.
Rather no direction than the wrong direction â€“ gods only contribute to war; itÂ´s better to be tolerantly caveman, uncaring of ideologies/world-views, than to be religious.
It seems mean to say that â€œitÂ´s their fault that religious wars keep on going â€“ those that wonÂ´t studyâ€, but itÂ´s good marketing.
â€œAccomplicesâ€.
As proof for that this science is new, the domain names â€œsizerange.comâ€, â€œanti-distinction.comâ€ and â€œenergymasspacetime.comâ€ are unregistered.
This book is worth you reading if it solves (or significantly helps) a major problem.
It is good marketing of my book to outline
the problem that I solve here.
USA is better than war, right? USA has poor folks committing crime â€“ thatÂ´s far better than nations waring. I move the problem from a macro-scale where nations fight eachother over oil, to an individualistic/family-based/friendship-based micro-scale where everyone feels as ideological/religious comrades â€“ empathy and friendship-buildingly sharing the knowledge of this book. I can get everyone to have the same ideology/religion-replacement so that thereÂ´ll be no war over the oil that has made us rich enough to not witness babies dying every day. Nations, races, ideologies, religions â€“ large groups â€“ makes the difference between war and crime. I solve the problems of macro-war and the friendship problem once everyone knows my diagrams. The post-oil decline isnÂ´t going to be pretty but we can take all measures to alleviate it â€“ spread this book.
If God is defined as â€œthe reason for existenceâ€ and I present a complete existential theory as a diagram, and I tattoo the diagram on my arm, is my
tattoo
then God? No, just a symbol for the reason for existence. One can tattoo an explanatory model for existence and God has during thousands of years been defined as the cause for existence.
My philosophy is to be real (to have an accurate concept of reality) but talking to religious people is like drifting away into a novel â€“ itÂ´s fiction but it (in some people) is beautiful. The greatest qualm I have about publishing my science is that it strips away the beautiful fiction novel as well as the hideous terrorism.
Why is it that the correct existential theory (which presumably should only be a big bang-type theory) inevitably is an
argument
against imaginary friends/lords? Couldnâ€™t God exist without having created the universe? God certainly didnÂ´t create the universe but religious people could have an imaginary friend despite that. A powerless god â€“ a pet god.
We have about 60 years to publish this science because after that the world economy starts going downhill and what today is â€œjustâ€ a trillion dollar thing (dealing with religion in the middle east) will become a clash of civilizations (as long as a billion people believe in the revealed word of Muhammed and form an anti-atheist group based on that). But imagine if I become known as the one who ended islam.
If I end religious war for good, imagine how much
the world will save by not having religious war.
Religious beliefs like â€œIÂ´ll go to heaven if I get killed in warâ€ rather than atheistic ones like â€œlife is meaningless and the best you can do is live good in peaceâ€ contribute to war. Furthermore the lack of an unambiguous pacifism in the Quran leads to that hate-preachers exist in every country and teach something like: â€œthe way to get order in this anarchy is to have all localsÂ´ holy book â€“ the Quran â€“ rule everyoneÂ´s lives and be global like the Quran claims it will be. Prophet Muhammed killed people. We need a sharia-based theocratic state because democracy produces promiscuity which is a sin God sends you to hell for. We muslims are not like the infidels/unbelievers/atheists and the Quran explicitly says to not be nice to infidels. An atheist is more hated than a jew.â€ My effort/book is a war-related effort because thereÂ´d be a clash of civilizations if the west insisted on drawing cartoons of prophet Muhammed and because ISIS/Boko-Haram fight religious wars.
Religion not only is a divider of people and motivator of effort in general, but some religions are more prone to excite war than others. Why would there be both the statements that martyrs get tens of virgins in heaven and that muslims are superior to infidels and should punish anyone for a list of things (drawing cartoons of Muhammed, insulting islam in general, leaving islam (converting to the true atheismâ€¦)) â€“ the Quran is clearly, by having this compilation of hate of atheism, ritualistic intolerance
globally (against cartoons
etc.) and a martyr-glorifying and rewarding dogma, a pro-war book.
In contrast, my book is anti-war because it teaches the abstract nature and meaninglessness of life â€“ in addition to that my book is the most universal book ever written while not demanding of you (with the punishment of death if you donÂ´t) to never leave whatÂ´s written in my book.
If I would tattoo a picture of Santa Claus on my chest and claim that IÂ´ve depicted prophet Muhammed (they both have beards), IÂ´d be hunted by a billion muslims. The hate of humor in islam is why my science is necessary.
Humor/satire is to me as an atheist the highest form of culture/civilization because it sparks good emotions and shows intelligence â€“ humor is my religion; itÂ´s the highest art IÂ´ve found in the universe. The fact that islam hates my religion is why
islam as it is today can never integrate into the modern world, causing a gap between muslims and everyone else that has been the cause of much death.
The TalibanÂ´s Afghanistan terrorized America for religious reasons, Bin Laden being a profoundly muslim figure. HusseinÂ´s Iraq, if its media wouldÂ´ve unified the country with the universal scientific culture, wouldÂ´ve been unable to fight the Americans in the Gulf War and Iraq war â€“ my science unifies people pacifying them through a psychological paradigm-shift. The unrest that arose in Iraq/Syria after US interference is super-religious, fighting for islam. The whole notion of â€œgetting Americans out of muslim landsâ€ declares the earth itself as wearing a religious book, making the region ungovernable because of two reasons: US doesnÂ´t do colonialism and because the afghans, Syrians, Iraqis (and other collapsed states) are unable to choose between a hard-core Islamic sharia government-system and a decadent promiscuous tolerant western governance. Islam not only offers but demands (at the threat of hell) a distinctly non-western system of government called theocracy. Islam collapses states by offering a medieval constitution called sharia. When war then breaks out, islamÂ´s to blame.
I should always remember to add the footnote that not all muslims support the theocratic sharia-law and thus do not cause a rift and civil war
where-ever governance collapses, even though the Quran demands that all muslims
vote for
sharia.
Ending religion might even have unforeseen consequences like if religion is a major brain-drain or if having a uniting global ideology spurs friendship so much so that the world needs less military spending.
If religion is ended tomorrow the USA can reduce its military spending because the main trouble-zone (the religious middle east) is gone (converted to atheism). A large US military in a world full of conflict is as powerful as a small US military in a world
where my science is mainstream. The world is messed up because it lacks my science and that warrants a big US military presence. If my science was known the US would need as much global military reach as is needed between California and Oregon. 1 billion people reading a holy book which says that atheists should be killed warrants a big military presence.
A much smaller US military is sufficient to quell all atheist conflicts.
Every fool has said â€œif all people would think just like me thereÂ´d be world-peaceâ€ but I have the opportunity to say that for real because all people need to do is learn a page of new science.
This is the universal symbol for the infinite square size-time-diagram with evolution as a triangle originating from
itsâ€™ middle, resulting in a brain. All standing thanks to three
foundational ideas: an infinite size-range, energymasspacetime and distinction-anti-distinction. Understanding this theory makes God impossible to believe in, defeating terrorists.
Awe (like the one everyone gets from my science) connects people, improving relationships and making them more likely to help strangers.
On all planets the company that spreads this science keeps getting investors in its stock until everyone is converted because itÂ´s a good cause and because you know thereÂ´ll be more investors tomorrow so you invest today.
ItÂ´s been scientifically tested that having religiousness helps you go through crises and religious people live longer than atheists. ItÂ´s healthy to have an imaginary friend like a 24/7 shrink who always listens to you, even though he doesnÂ´t say anything except to schizophrenics who hear voices in their heads. My work at defeating religion has the negative side-effect of removing the health benefits that come from believing in religion.
WhatÂ´s true and whatÂ´s healthy do not necessarily overlap.
This book shows that itÂ´s possible to write a universal sequence of thought / course / book. YouÂ´ve seen how certain truth leads to an existential theory which defeats God. This is the first â€œholy bookâ€, if you will. ItÂ´s more universal than the medieval â€œholy booksâ€.
Do you think my book is more universal than the medieval holy books?
IÂ´ve advanced to the level in science where IÂ´m no longer in the mainstream tolerance-era where anything goes and gets accepted regarding thought. Cavemen all knew the same facts about life and didnÂ´t tolerate random anythings. Now that my book has proven whatÂ´s true, why should we be unlike cavemen toward that which my book proves to be wrong? The ability to think makes us humans and distinct from apes â€“ why then do we live in an era where weÂ´re taught culturally to
tolerate absolutely anything?
We currently live in an era of tolerance â€“ tolerance is taught to kids around the world. â€œWhatever people believe â€“ respect it.â€ This â€œanything goesâ€-attitude toward thinking/beliefs makes future historians call our era â€œthe era of toleranceâ€. That era will transition into an era, thanks to my work, where we know whatÂ´s true. ItÂ´s not an era of intolerance like the eras preceding our current era were. ItÂ´s just wrong and frowned upon to uphold superstitions, especially if theyÂ´re themselves prideful/hateful like the â€œmuslims are better than infidelsâ€-belief in islam. Everyone will know my science and see that the correct â€œconnection with Godâ€ is a feeling is awe-inspiring meaninglessness but honor in that weÂ´ve finally, globally, have learned to think (in a wide lens). WeÂ´ll know whatÂ´s right and whatÂ´s wrong and thereÂ´ll be less of an â€œanything goes and is acceptedâ€-attitude toward thought â€“ so yes: less tolerance but not intolerance.
The pen is mightier than the sword â€“ books have always changed wars.

Texten bÃ¶rjar med sÃ¤ker sanning, sedan gÃ¥r den till att fÃ¶rklara varfÃ¶r nÃ¥gonting existerar istÃ¤llet fÃ¶r ingenting (den existentiella teorin â€“ varfÃ¶r vi existerar), sedan gÃ¥r den till evolutionÃ¤r teori vilket fÃ¶rutsÃ¤gs av den existentiella teorin. Den evolutionÃ¤ra teorin fÃ¶rklarar vardagsfenomen.
Du vet med sÃ¤kerhet att du tÃ¤nker och att du existerar eftersom om du skulle bliva lurad av en allsmÃ¤ktig demon som fÃ¶rsÃ¶ker lura dig i allt du kan bli lurad i, sÃ¥ Ã¤r lurendrejeriet i sig en tanke-process och dÃ¤rfÃ¶r vet du att tankar existerar (du tÃ¤nker). FÃ¶r att du ska bli lurad sÃ¥ mÃ¥ste du existera och dÃ¤rfÃ¶r vet du â€jag existerarâ€. Att bli lurad Ã¤r en tankeprocess och tÃ¤nkaren Ã¤r nÃ¶dvÃ¤ndig fÃ¶r att det ska finnas nÃ¥gon som blir lurad. SÃ¥ du vet: oavsett vad sÃ¥ tÃ¤nker du och existerar du. Ã…vanstÃ¥ende Ã¤r tvÃ¥ saker, eller hur? De Ã¤r bÃ¥da del av samma hjÃ¤rna och samma tankeprocess kan bli ens analytiska verktygssats/tÃ¤nkare, men vi erkÃ¤nner Ã¤ndÃ¥ att det finns distinkta entiteter â€“ att det finns distinktion. Detta kan ocksÃ¥ kallas separation. Vad Ã¤r distinktions motsats, anti-distinktion? Det Ã¤r en verklighet; det som allt Ã¤r del av; den Ã¤r en och dess definition i ordboken Ã¤r att allt Ã¤r del av den. Om vi skriver distinktion (tÃ¤nkare och tanke) pÃ¥ vÃ¤nster sida av ett papper och anti-distinktion (verkligheten; det som allt Ã¤r del av; en) pÃ¥ hÃ¶ger sida av pappret â€“ kan den vÃ¤nstra sidan se den hÃ¶gra sidan? Nej, fÃ¶r att oppositionen mellan distinktion och anti-distinktion. Det finns alltid en observerare (tÃ¤nkaren) och dÃ¤rmed distinktion i varje observation och dÃ¤rmed kan anti-distinktion ej representeras/ses.
HjÃ¤rnan evolverade fÃ¶r att hantera naturliga fenomen â€“ det fanns aldrig ett scenario i historien dÃ¥ nÃ¥gonting osynligt behÃ¶vde hanteras och betÃ¤nkas. DÃ¤rfÃ¶r antar vi att tanke-processen blev fel nÃ¤r vi sÃ¤ger att distinktion/vi inte kan se anti-distinktion/verkligheten. Men tankeprocessen gick inte fel: allt det betyder Ã¤r att det finns mer till verkligheten Ã¤n kan representeras. Oavsett hur vagt â€representerasâ€ Ã¤r definierat, lÃ¥t oss sÃ¤ga att en kaffekopp â€“ oavsett om hjÃ¤rnor Ã¤r involverade eller inte â€“ antas fÃ¶rsÃ¶ka representera det som allt Ã¤r del av, dÃ¥ gÃ¶r anti-distinktions-distinktions-oppositionen (motsÃ¤ttningen mellan distinktion och dess motsats) att representationen Ã¤r inkorrekt. Vi kan frÃ¥ga om en anti-distinkt â€sakâ€ har en maximumstorlek och dÃ¤rmed distinktion? Nej. PÃ¥ samma not Ã¤r ett annat bevis fÃ¶r att storleksskalan Ã¤r oÃ¤ndlig Ã¤r att vi ser nÃ¥gonting (vÃ¥r vardagsvÃ¤rld) samt kan gÃ¶ra hypoteser ad infinitum, och Ã¤ndÃ¥ representerar ingenting ALL verklighet. Verkligheten dvs storlek-tid Ã¤r dÃ¤rfÃ¶r oÃ¤ndligt.
En oÃ¤ndlig storleksskala Ã¤r en av pelarna i den existentiella teorin. En annan pelare Ã¤r att energimassa och rumtid Ã¤r motsatser (opposition) men sammanflÃ¤tade sÃ¥som i E=mc
2
(dÃ¤r c
2
hÃ¤nvisar till en hastighet dvs rum Ã¶ver tid: rumtid). Multiplikationen sammanfÃ¶r energimassa tillsammans med rumtid; ingenting tillsammans med nÃ¥gonting/allting; existens tillsammans med icke-existens. VarfÃ¶r finns det existens i form av min kropp? Utan att gÃ¥ in i det historiska svaret sÃ¥ kan man fÃ¶rklara det genom att sÃ¤ga att kroppen Ã¤r nÃ¥gonting i (sammanflÃ¤tat med) ingenting, av en storlek i en oÃ¤ndlig storleks-skala (dÃ¤r relationen mellan vilka tvÃ¥ storlekar som helst (eller objekt av tvÃ¥ storlekar) Ã¤r att de Ã¤r fÃ¶rklaringen till varandra dvs rÃ¤ttfÃ¤rdigar varandra. Sedan finns det ocksÃ¥, som tredje pelare, distinktions-anti-distinktions-opposition dvs vi lever i en singular (ej plural) verklighet men ser distinkta/separata entiteter sÃ¥som tÃ¤nkare och tanke.
PÃ¥ tal om rumtid, rumtid Ã¤r den logiska startpunkten fÃ¶r den tidsbaserade existentiella teorin. Ingenting (tom rumtid) behÃ¶ver inget inledande/tidigare rÃ¤ttfÃ¤rdigande eller anledning att existera, fÃ¶r att det existerar inte. I den, hursomhelst, Ã¤r naturlagarna sanna dvs den Ã¤r inte irrationell / anti-logisk, och bland naturlagarna finns de som, inklusive E=mc
2
, som nÃ¤mner energimassa. Skulle energimassa kunna â€nÃ¤mnasâ€ utan att det skulle existera? Om â€jaâ€ sÃ¥ skulle det vara absurt / anti-logiskt. VarfÃ¶r skulle verkligheten nÃ¤mna saker som aldrig existerar? Eftersom naturlagarna Ã¤r strikta och tack vare vÃ¥r regel â€det som nÃ¤mns mÃ¥ste existera eller uppstÃ¥â€ sÃ¥ fÃ¥r vi, varÃ¤n (i de minsta storlekarna) dÃ¤r E=mc
2
nÃ¤mns, sÃ¥ finns existens och dÃ¤rfÃ¶r en tÃ¤t big bang. Faktumet att galaxer rusar ivÃ¤g accelererandes frÃ¥n varandra leder till ingenting (tom rymd) i framtiden, och med mellanhanden â€naturlagarâ€ sÃ¥ uppstÃ¥r energimassa igen sÃ¥ tÃ¤t som den kan vara. Ingen tids-delay mellan ingenting â€“ naturlagar â€“ energimassa men sÃ¥ snart en begrÃ¤nsad (av event-horizons som bestÃ¤ms av ljuset Ã¤ndliga hastighet) region blir ingenting/tomrum, sÃ¥ uppstÃ¥r en big bang som sedan genom kosmisk expansion blir ingenting igen, som sedan blir tomrum och en ny big bang igen. Detta Ã¤r den tidsmÃ¤ssiga beskrivningen om varfÃ¶r energimassa (som existerar sammanflÃ¤tad med rumtid sÃ¥som i E=mc
2
) bÃ¶rjar tÃ¤t och blir ingenting, och sedan repetitation.
Det Ã¥vanstÃ¥ende Ã¤r en rivalteori till â€Gud skapade jorden pÃ¥ 6 dagar och vilade pÃ¥ den sjundeâ€. Den Ã¤r inte intuitiv eftersom den har att gÃ¶ra med saker som vi inte hade att gÃ¶ra med under evolutionen: osynliga energimassarumtid/verkligheten/anti-distinktion som del av vÃ¥rt resonemang. Den har ocksÃ¥ en multi-anledning orsak fÃ¶r vÃ¥r existens: en tidsvis rationale involverandes bÃ¶rjan och slutet pÃ¥ big bang, kombinerad med en 3-pelares existentiell teori som rÃ¤ttfÃ¤rdigar storlek och energimassa. Den Ã¤r abstrakt/vetenskaplig men kan inte reduceras till simplare termer. Det Ã¤r den minsta gemensamma nÃ¤mnaren som alla kan tro pÃ¥ (oavsett religion).
Hur vagt har verkligheten definerat â€att representeraâ€?
OÃ¤ndligt vagt â€“ vad som helst kan representera vad som helst.
Ã„r representationen/representÃ¶ren verkligheten eller Allah?
Nej.
Kan nÃ¥gonting representera det som allt Ã¤r del av?
Nej.
DÃ¥ Ã¤r storleks-tids-diagrammet oÃ¤ndligt dvs inget representerar verkligheten. Hur mÃ¥nga Ã¤r den? Hur mÃ¥nga Ã¤r Allah? 1.
Sa denâ€¦, eller skrev den en bok?
Detta motbevisar att Allah skrev en bok.
Igen: hur mycket av verkligheten kan representeras av, sÃ¤g, en mÃ¥lning? All den?
Nej, hela verkligheten kan ej representeras. Precis som Allah inte kan fÃ¥ngas i ett ord/en bild.
Vi kan ha hypoteser â€“ hur mÃ¥nga hypoteser kan vi ha?
Om verkligheten Ã¤r storlekar och tider, energimassa och rumtid sÃ¥ Ã¤r det rektangulÃ¤ra storleks-tids-diagrammet med energimassarumtid i varje koordinat det universella sÃ¤ttet att representera allt som finns att representera.
Skriver den bÃ¶cker? Nej, den Ã¤r inte av fÃ¶rfattarnatur.
â€Gud sa till Muhammed ord fÃ¶r ordâ€¦â€ Ã¤r alltsÃ¥ ett falskt eller som mest ett metaforiskt pÃ¥stÃ¥ende.
â€Du mÃ¥ste gÃ¶ra ritualer fÃ¶r att inte hamna i helvetet, och i himmelen fÃ¥r du 72 oskulderâ€ Ã¤r med samma logik ocksÃ¥ ett falskt pÃ¥stÃ¥ende.
Det finns tre alternativ som fundament fÃ¶r denna logik â€“ kan du tÃ¤nka ut ett fjÃ¤rde?
1: Verkligheten Ã¤r ett synonym fÃ¶r Allah,
2: eller sÃ¥ finns inte Allah
3: eller sÃ¥ finns 72 oskulder (ej ett alternativ eftersom verkligheten inte Ã¤r av den naturen, dÃ¥ den Ã¤r storleks-tids-energimassarumtid, att den skriver bÃ¶cker).
Som tillÃ¤gg till det rektangulÃ¤ra storleks-tids-diagrammet med oÃ¤ndlighetssymboler i varje hÃ¶rn, och den evolutionÃ¤ra triangeln som representerar att livet blev mer komplext ju mer tiden gick (triangelns spets har sitt ursprung i mittersta storleken i den kÃ¤nda storleksskalan), finns fÃ¶ljande hjÃ¤rn-diagram:
Den existentiella teorin med dess tre pelare, dvs en oÃ¤ndlig storleksskala, energimassarumtid och distinktions-anti-distinktions-opposition, fÃ¶rutsÃ¤ger att det borde finnas en liten bit DNA som kopierar sig.
Evolutionsteorin bÃ¶rjar med den fÃ¶rsta reproducerande formen. Det var en form som samlande kringliggande massa till en liknande form. Den existentiella teorin fÃ¶rutsÃ¤ger existensen av oÃ¤ndligt mÃ¥nga sÃ¥dana former. Det som oundvikligen blir sant nÃ¤r man har reproduktion Ã¤r att vissa dÃ¶r medan andra Ã¶verlever (liv och dÃ¶d), att antalet avkomma/kopior formen gÃ¶r har betydelse och att det finns mutationer Ã¶ver tid. FÃ¶ljande Ã¤r sant om formens avkomma: vissa dÃ¶r medan andra Ã¶verlever, antalet avkomma har betydelse och avkomman Ã¤r annorlunda frÃ¥n originalformen. Dessa tre regler / naturlagar var inaktiva innan den fÃ¶rsta reproduktionen skedde. NÃ¤sta stora steg var nÃ¤r ett av dessa former mÃ¶jliggjorde fÃ¶r sig sjÃ¤lv att injicera sitt DNA in i andra formers reproduktiva mekanism, vilket utnyttjade princip nr 2: att antalet avkomma har betydelse. Det var det fÃ¶rsta viruset: den hijackade andras reproduktion. Regeln / naturlagen som kom i spel i.om. denna hÃ¤ndelse var att â€maktâ€ har betydelse: att hijacka andras reproduktiva mekanism ger evolutionÃ¤ra fÃ¶rdelar. Nu har vi lagt fram de fyra huvudregelerna som Ã¤r evolutionsteori: fÃ¶rst kom de tre fÃ¶rsta reglerna, sedan kom den fjÃ¤rde: makt. NÃ¤sta stora hÃ¤ndelse â€“ fÃ¶r att skydda mot att virus hijackar alla reproduktiva system â€“ var att ett immunsystem evolverade fÃ¶r att skydda mot virus hijacks-fÃ¶rsÃ¶k. Detta behÃ¶vde multicellulÃ¤rism. Precis som immunsystem krÃ¤ver multicellularism, sÃ¥ behÃ¶ver immunsystem multikÃ¶nadhet: fÃ¶r att vinna i kampen dÃ¤r virus muterar fÃ¶r att kringgÃ¥ immunsystem sÃ¥ behÃ¶ver immunsystemet ocksÃ¥ maximalt med mutation. Att mixa gener frÃ¥n tvÃ¥ kÃ¶n skapar ett mer muterat immunsystem, vilket hÃ¥ller ut i kampen mot virus dÃ¤r virus â€fÃ¶rsÃ¶kerâ€ mutera sig runt immunsystemet. Den nÃ¤sta stora hÃ¤ndelsen var att en av dessa multicellulÃ¤ra organismer â€“ en fisk eller mask â€“ av det manliga kÃ¶net muterade till att vara agressiv och fÃ¶rinta andra manliga varelser. Han skulle ha fÃ¥tt hÃ¶gre tillgÃ¥ng till kvinnliga organismer jÃ¤mfÃ¶rt med hans icke-agressiva likar. Detta kan ocksÃ¥ kallas â€maktâ€ eftersom agressiva hanar hijackar andra hanars tillgÃ¥ng till kvinnor genom att dÃ¶da hanarna. Detta orsakar dinosaurierna eftersom stÃ¶rre muskelmassa och skarpare vapen Ã¤r bÃ¤ttre pÃ¥ att dÃ¶da rivalerna. Bland dinosaurierna fanns moder-avkomma-bandet, ditplacerad av evolutionen eftersom det var en fÃ¶rdel fÃ¶r mÃ¶drar att se sina barn Ã¶verleva till vuxenskap. Detta band muterade till att involvera flock-medlemmar eftersom en grupp sammarbetandes bÃ¤ttre kan vinna Ã¶ver individualister i brÃ¥k om vad som helst. NÃ¤sta stora steg var att nÃ¥gon kartlade flocken, i sin hjÃ¤rna, som en hierarki (upp-ned-axeln) med en lÃ¤ngtan efter att stÃ¥ hÃ¶gst upp i hierarkin. Denna kapitalistiska tÃ¤vlan mot toppen gjorde att hjÃ¤rnan vÃ¤xte sig stÃ¶rre â€“ stÃ¶rre minnesbank, mer detaljrika fÃ¶rutsÃ¤gelser och snabbare planering Ã¤r alla fÃ¶rdelar som kommer frÃ¥n att ha ett stÃ¶rre kortex.
Du har en komposit-sÃ¤ker sanning bestÃ¥endes av tvÃ¥ sÃ¤kra sanningar: du kan med sÃ¤kerhet sÃ¤ga att du tÃ¤nker (fÃ¶r att om du skulle bli lurad: att bli lurad Ã¤r en tankeprocess) och att du existerar (eftersom att bli lurad krÃ¤ver den som blir lurad). Jag tÃ¤nker och jag finns Ã¤r ett pÃ¥stÃ¥ende men tvÃ¥ sanningar. Du kan med sÃ¤kerhet pÃ¥stÃ¥ dig ha â€distinktionâ€ eftersom du har att gÃ¶ra med multipla separata entiteter (sÃ¥som â€jagâ€ och â€tankarâ€). Man kan sÃ¤ga, nÃ¤r man ser den sÃ¤kra sanningens â€jag tÃ¤nkerâ€ och â€jag existerarâ€, att avstÃ¥endet/mellanrummet mellan de tvÃ¥ idÃ©erna (tÃ¤nkare och tanke) Ã¤r distinktion. AvstÃ¥endet/mellanrummet som separarar tÃ¤nkare frÃ¥n tanke Ã¤r nÃ¶dvÃ¤ndigt fÃ¶r â€disktinktionâ€ att hÃ¤rledas som sÃ¤ker sanning fÃ¶ljandes ur nÃ¤sta logiska steg, med ursprunget av den originella primÃ¤ra sÃ¤kra sanningen.
Ã„r alla distinkta entiteter del av en singulÃ¤r verklighet om â€verklighetenâ€ Ã¤r definierad som â€det som allt Ã¤r del avâ€? Med andra ord: om vi ritar distinktion pÃ¥ vÃ¤nster sida av ett papper och anti-distinktion (distinktionÂ´s motsats: en ensam verklighet â€“ det som allt Ã¤r del av. Zoomandes ut maximalt) pÃ¥ hÃ¶ger sida av pappret, kan dÃ¥ distinktion representera hÃ¶ger sida av pappret dvs anti-distinktion? Hur skulle nÃ¥gon distinkt entitet kunna vara/representera motsatsen till vad representation/distinktion Ã¤r? Vilken representation som helst av anti-distinktion/verkligheten mÃ¥ste ha minst tre entiteter: tÃ¤nkare, mellanrummet mellan tÃ¤nkare och tanke, och tanke.
Separation/distinktion Ã¤r antaget i representation, vilket innebÃ¤r att anti-distinktion Ã¤r orepreserbart.
Hur vagt har universum/Gud definerat vad en representation Ã¤r dvs nÃ¤r en representation sker? VÃ¥ra hjÃ¤rnor anvÃ¤nder neuroner fÃ¶r att representera, men vad sÃ¤gs om â€“ istÃ¤llet fÃ¶r neuroner (oavsett om hjÃ¤rnor Ã¤r inblandade eller inte) â€“ universum lÃ¥ter vilket slumpmÃ¤ssigt valt objekt som helst lÃ¥ta sig sÃ¤gas, sÃ¥som neuroner sÃ¤gs, representera verkligheten? Universum har definierat â€representationâ€ oÃ¤ndligt vagt dvs uteslutandes hjÃ¤rnor sÃ¥ kan vilket slumpmÃ¤ssigt objekt som helst spotant bli/vara symbolen fÃ¶r all verklighet â€“ fÃ¶r att universum har definierat â€representeraâ€ oÃ¤ndligt vagt. Trots den oÃ¤ndligt vaga definitionen av vad som representerar vad, sÃ¥ gÃ¶r distinktions-anti-distinktions-oppositionen (linjen som separerar vÃ¤nster sida av pappret frÃ¥n hÃ¶ger sida; motsÃ¤ttningen mellan distinktion och anti-distinktion) att verkligheten Ã¤r orepresenterbar. Om verkligheten Ã¤r anti-distinktion dÃ¥ finns ingen distinktion (representation Ã¤r oundvikligen distinktion), trots universums oÃ¤ndligt vaga definition av â€representeraâ€, fÃ¥nga verkligheten. I representationer kan vi rÃ¤kna minst tre saker och det vi fÃ¶rsÃ¶ker representera Ã¤r en sak utan nÃ¥gonting utanfÃ¶r den. Faktumet att representationer innehÃ¥ller distinktion gÃ¶r att att fÃ¥nga verkligheten (allt som ett) omÃ¶jligt.
Vi kan ha oÃ¤ndligt mÃ¥nga eller oÃ¤ndligt innehÃ¥llsfulla/stora representationer/hypoteser â€“ sÃ¥som ett oÃ¤ndligt storleks-tids-diagram â€“ och genom att abstrakt peka till verkligheten, sÃ¥ gÃ¶r universums regel att ingenting representerar verkligheten trots universums oÃ¤ndligt vaga definition av â€representeraâ€ av oÃ¤ndligt mycket, gÃ¶r verkligheten orepresenterbar. Detta kan bara betyda en sak: verkligheten â€“ som vi kÃ¤nner som storlekar och tider (ett storleks-tids-diagram) â€“ Ã¤r oÃ¤ndligt. Det finns oÃ¤ndligt stort och oÃ¤ndligt litet med oÃ¤ndligt mycket dÃ¥tid och oÃ¤ndligt mycket framtid. Detta rektangulÃ¤ra storleks-tids-diagram dvs vÃ¥r vardagsvÃ¤rld av storlek-tid har oÃ¤ndligheter Ã¶verallt.
Energimassa i rumtid: ett i noll, existens i icke-existens, nÃ¥gonting i ingenting â€“ sÃ¥som definierats av E=mc
2
dÃ¤r c

stÃ¥r fÃ¶r ljusets hastighet (rum Ã¶ver tid dvs rumtid/noll/icke-existens) och E=m refererar till energimassa (existens, nÃ¥gonting, allt).
Distinktions-anti-distinktions-opposition: vi lever i en singulÃ¤r verklighet men vi ser multipla objekt.
En oÃ¤ndlig storleksskala.
De Ã¥vanstÃ¥ende tre idÃ©erna Ã¤r en existentiell teori (en teori som fÃ¶rklarar existensen av en reproduktiv form dvs evolutions bÃ¶rjan dvs vÃ¥r existens). Det Ã¤r modernt att anvÃ¤nda sig av tre likvÃ¤rdiga idÃ©er fÃ¶r att fÃ¶rklara ens existens â€“ alla tidigare existentiella teorier har antingen anvÃ¤nt en enda idÃ© (monoteism) eller en saga/myt (mÃ¥nga vardagliga (ej vetenskapliga/abstrakta) idÃ©er) fÃ¶r att fÃ¶rklara existens.
Den fÃ¶rutsÃ¤gande kvalitÃ©n som gÃ¶r denna existentiella teori till en vetenskaplig teori Ã¤r att den, baserat pÃ¥ en oÃ¤ndlig storleksskala av energimassarumtid och distinktions-anti-distinktions-opposition, fÃ¶rutsÃ¤ger att det i en oÃ¤ndlig storleksskala borde finnas en storlek dÃ¤r reproduktion (DNA) sker. Den existentiella teorin fÃ¶rutsÃ¤ger det fÃ¶rsta DNA:t, och frÃ¥n det fÃ¥r vi evolutionÃ¤r teori.
En annan fÃ¶rutsÃ¤gande kvalitÃ© Ã¤r att teorin fÃ¶rutsÃ¤ger att big bang borde varit
tÃ¤t
. A-priori begynnelsen av universum Ã¤r logiskt sett tomhet eftersom tomhet inte behÃ¶ver nÃ¥gon tidigare/fÃ¶religgande logiskt rÃ¤ttfÃ¤rdigande eftersom det ej existerar. I tom rumtid Ã¤r naturlagarna sanna, sÃ¥som naturlagarna som hanterar energimassa (sÃ¥som E=mc
2
), och dÃ¤rfÃ¶r bÃ¶rjar big bang oÃ¤ndligt tÃ¤t â€“ fÃ¶r att E=mc
2
Ã¤r lika sann samtidigt i de minsta storlekarna. De minsta tomma rymderna hade E=mc
2
som sann inom sig direkt nÃ¤r det fanns ingenting, vilket fÃ¶rutsÃ¤ger en tÃ¤t big bang. En region, inom event horizons gjorda av energimassa rusandes ivÃ¤g i >c (pga mÃ¶rk energi accelererandes kosmisk expansion) Ã¤r per definition â€ingentingâ€ i vilket E=mc
2
Ã¤r sann i de minsta utrymmena, vilket Ã¥stadkommer en big bang utom rÃ¤ckhÃ¥ll fÃ¶r de nÃ¤rmaste ( v = >c) energimassa. Ingenting (utom rÃ¤ckhÃ¥ll fÃ¶r nÃ¤rmaste energimassa fÃ¶r att den Ã¤r pÃ¥ vÃ¤g bortÃ¥t i >c) orsakas i centrumpunkten som har event horizons som grÃ¤ns lÃ¤ngst bort, vilket leder till en big bang (eftersom naturlagarna uppbringar energimassa i det tomma centrumet).
Det Ã¤r en stor historisk hÃ¤ndelse att det Ã¤ntligen finns ett ateistiskt argument i form av en universitetskurs: det Ã¤r en existentiell teori plus evolution som inte behÃ¶ver en personifierad gud fÃ¶r att fungera, utan dess pelare (oÃ¤ndlig storleksskala av energimassarumtid och distinktions-anti-distinktions-opposition) kan inte ha en personifierad gud tillagd till dem som en fjÃ¤rde pelare utan att teorin lÃ¥ter lÃ¶jlig. Det Ã¤r inte bara sÃ¥ att teorin inte behÃ¶ver en personifierad gud, utan att lÃ¤gga till en gud fÃ¶rstÃ¶r teorins minimalistiska rationellt kompletta skÃ¶nhet. Gudar fÃ¶rfular teorin. Teorins upptÃ¤ckt Ã¤r en stor historisk hÃ¤ndelse eftersom aldrig fÃ¶rr har en hel kurs (bÃ¶rjandes med sÃ¤ker sanning, gÃ¥endes genom den existentiella teorin och slutandes i evolution) lagts fram i ateismens intellektuella debatt, som ett argument mot en personifierad gud.
Anatomin i hjÃ¤rnan frÃ¥n att hÃ¶ra sÃ¤ker sanning (jag tÃ¤nker & jag finns) â€“ bÃ¶rjan av denna kurs â€“ skapar samma neuronala pathways / associationer mellan idÃ©er i varje person som hÃ¶r vet sÃ¤ker sanning. Det logiska steget till â€distinktionâ€ Ã¤r att notera, som meta-analys av den primÃ¤ra sÃ¤kra sanningen â€“ att man har mÃ¥nga idÃ©er (jag tÃ¤nker OCH jag finns) och att man kan ta den logiska vÃ¤gen till nÃ¤sta steg i kursen (distinktion finns). Att sedan motsÃ¤tta anti-distinktion med distinktion skapar den ofÃ¶rnimmbara â€“ â€mot resonâ€ (eftersom logik Ã¤r, i simpla mÃ¤nniskor, enbart visuell) â€“ slutsatsen att vi/distinktion inte kan se verkligheten/anti-distinktion. Distinktions-anti-distinktions-oppositionen Ã¤r svÃ¥rbegriplig fÃ¶r att den â€“ sÃ¥som formell logik eller matematik â€“ enbart anvÃ¤nder ord istÃ¤llet fÃ¶r bilder (den lingvistiska hjÃ¤rnhalvan istÃ¤llet fÃ¶r den visuella). Vi evolverade till att sÃ¤ga â€om jag kan se det sÃ¥ tror jag pÃ¥ detâ€ och det Ã¤r en god tumregel eftersom praktiska sekvenser hÃ¤ndelser kan verifieras som sanna eller osanna genom att visualisera dem. Men i denna filosofi: nej â€“ det mÃ¥ste vara lingvistiskt att vi fÃ¶rnekar oss sjÃ¤lva konceptet â€all verklighetâ€, vilket leder till slutsatsen att det finns mer till verkligheten Ã¤n nÃ¥gonting â€“ oavsett hur vagt universum definerat â€att representeraâ€ â€“ representerar. Detta tillÃ¤gger oÃ¤ndligt mÃ¥nga storlekar till vÃ¥r abstrakta stoorleksskala / storleks-tids-diagrammet; det gÃ¶r en rektangel (med storlek pÃ¥ y-axeln och tid pÃ¥ x-axeln) med oÃ¤ndlighetstecken i varje hÃ¶rn, som i sin tur blir en pelare i vÃ¥r personlig-gud-fÃ¶rnekande existentiella teori.
Att komma frÃ¥n sÃ¤ker sanningen genom enbart logiska steg (meta-analyser och motsÃ¤ttningsskapande av motsatser) till en existentiell teori som fÃ¶rutsÃ¤er evolutionen Ã¤r en stor historisk hÃ¤ndelse i ateismens historia.
I ett historiskt sammanhang Ã¤r anatomin (neurala anslutningar mellan idÃ©er och sekvenser logik) som skapas av denna kurs som ett paradigm-shifte in i en ny era av civilisation â€“ en era liknande den som finns pÃ¥ oÃ¤ndligt mÃ¥nga planeter vars vetenskap kommit lÃ¤ngre Ã¤n vÃ¥ra 4.5 miljarder Ã¥rs mittenpunkt i en vanlig vattenbÃ¤rande planets historia.
Evolution, genom att bÃ¶rja frÃ¥n â€en massa som samlar kringliggande massa till en liknande formâ€ kliver fram frÃ¥n den existentiella teorins oÃ¤ndliga storleksskala av energimassarumtid. Om vi antar att DNA Ã¤r replikationsmolekylen sÃ¥ kan vi ta steget till â€“ klivandes Ã¶ver hur cellvÃ¤ggar evolverade osv â€“ till att virus hijackar andras reproduktiva system. Detta â€“ i den universella inter-planetÃ¤ra rymdvarelsekulturen â€“ formuleras som, i bÃ¶cker av logik, som att de tre fÃ¶rsta reglerna uppkommer (liv/dÃ¶d, antalet avkomma har betydelse och â€det sker mutationer i varje generationsskifteâ€) och sedan att en fjÃ¤rde regel uppkommer (makt, med virus). Denna historia â€“ som i vÃ¥r kurs bÃ¶rjar frÃ¥n den fÃ¶rsta reproduktiva formen och slutar i att finslipa anatomin bakom makt i mÃ¤n â€“ Ã¤r visualiseringsbar som en grottmanna-historias narrativ likt dem vi evolverade till att se/hÃ¶ra. Vi kan proof-checka/validera historian genom att se den visuellt. Evolutions visuella natur Ã¤r i stark kontrast till den rent linguistiska/abstraka natur som den existentiella teorin har.
PÃ¥ tal om â€abstraktaâ€ beskrivningar dvs beskrivningar som gÃ¶r det vÃ¤ldigt klart fÃ¶r oss att vÃ¥r fÃ¶rstÃ¥else av universum bara Ã¤r en karta (en referens) och inte verkligheten i sig (tÃ¤nk pÃ¥ PlatoÂ´s och KantÂ´s grottmetafor och â€saken Ã¤r inte saken sjÃ¤lvâ€-filosofierâ€)â€¦ Storleksskalan av energimassarumtid, i storleken av kvantfysik har oss beskrivandes fotoner etc anvÃ¤ndandes bÃ¥de vÃ¥g-beskrivningar med fokus pÃ¥ lÃ¤ngder i rymd (dessa Ã¤r â€rumtids-beskrivningarâ€) OCH â€“ i vÃ¥r-partikel-dualitet â€“ energimassabeskrivningen dvs att energin i en foton Ã¤r dess fÃ¤rg. FÃ¤rg (sÃ¥som den uppfattas genom Ã¶gonen), vÃ¥g/rumtids-beskrivningen och partikel-energi/energimassa-beskrivningen Ã¤r alla legitimea beskrivningar av kvantfysiken. VÃ¥r fÃ¶rmÃ¥ga att beskriva vilken massa/vilket fenomen som helst med bÃ¥de energimassa- och rumtids-beskrivningar lÃ¶per genom hela storleksskalan. Du kan fÃ¶restÃ¤lla dig tvÃ¥ linjer â€“ en fÃ¶r energimassa och en fÃ¶r rumtid â€“ gÃ¥endes vertikalt genom alla bilder pÃ¥ storleks-axeln. TillÃ¤ggandes komplexitet pÃ¥ detta finns det tvÃ¥ linjer till â€“ tyngdlagen och elektromagnetism â€“ bÃ¥da gÃ¥endes lÃ¤ngs storleks-axeln, tyngdlagen har dess dualitet av energimassa- och rumtids-beskrivningar och elektromagnetism likasÃ¥ har desamma, dvs energimassa och rumtidsbeskrivningar. Tyngdlagen Ã¤r bÃ¥de Newtonisk â€massor dras till massorâ€ (energimassas fokus pÃ¥ massa) och Einsteinsk â€rumtids krÃ¶kningâ€ (rumtids fokus pÃ¥ rum) â€“ bÃ¥da beskrivningar Ã¤r korrekta.
Vi Ã¤r halvvÃ¤gs igenom en planets historia â€“ 4.5 miljarder Ã¥r har gÃ¥tt och 5 miljarder Ã¥terstÃ¥r. Teorin som du nu vet Ã¤r m.a.o. i kosmisk majoritet â€“ fler planeter har den Ã¤n har den inte (om det tar ungefÃ¤r hÃ¤lften av planetens historia att uppfinna den och om den kvarstÃ¥r under andra hÃ¤lften av planetens historia). De flesta andra planeter dvs majoriteten av rymdvarelser Ã¤r m.a.o. ideologiska anhÃ¤ngare av teorin. Sprid denna teori fÃ¶r att fÃ¥ bekrÃ¤ftelse av majoriteten trots att den bor ljusÃ¥r bort. Just nu lever 99.9% av jordens befolkning i eran av religioner â€“ sprid denna teori fÃ¶r att fÃ¥ slut pÃ¥ religiÃ¶sa krig samt terrorism sÃ¥som 9/11. VÃ¤rldsbilden (bilden/diagrammet som fÃ¶rklarar vÃ¤rlden) Ã¤r densamma i den kosmiska majoriteten.
Jag har jobbat i 10 Ã¥r fÃ¶r att Ã¥stadkomma teorin och som ensam om att kÃ¤nna till den Ã¤r det mitt ansvar att den sprids. Den framtida civilizationen i vilken alla har samma vÃ¤rldsbild hÃ¤nger dÃ¤rfÃ¶r pÃ¥ mig. Jag kÃ¤nner en unik mÃ¶jlighet att pÃ¥verka jordens framtid.

Can we
timetravel? We can proceed from era to era, just like dinosaurs preceded man and not vice versa â€“ its a universal sequence on any planet.
Heaven/karma instinctual but collides with main picture.
Water, primordial soup, proteins, dns strand. Single cell reproducing multiplying. Then 1 of these cells thought â€œill inject my own dna into some other cellâ€, hijack its reproductive system. Very beneficial. So first there were 3 rules: life n death, number of offspring matters and mutation in each generationshift, then with viruses came the 4th rule â€œpowerâ€ â€“ hijacking othersâ€™ reproductive system. Then theres an arms race between viruses and â€¦ â€œOur kind ofâ€ organism, so to mutate our immune system faster two genders arose. Then fights between males led to the dinosaurs. Then brains bonded into groups to fight individualists. Then capitalist power struggles within the group made the brain grow larger, weâ€™re good at planning and remembering things. Then we get to kingdoms. From the water puddle to the 21 st century. Those who proceed to the next era will live in a world where holy book-group bonds are weak and a universal courses group bond is the strongest, thus national wars or civilizational wars where identity is based on other than this science will be impossible. The planet has two future ways to go 60 years from now and one is better but needs some investment of time until everybody knows this course.
Theres a universal course/book thats on every advanced enough planet throughout the universe and at the regeneration of every universe. If you consider the entire corpus of human knowledge, youd find 3 rational starting points: certain truth, nothingness and that reality is one. Just like dinosaurs predate humans the first chapter with the 3 starting points predate the connecting of â€œi think n i exist, distinctionâ€ and â€œreality is one, antidistinction. Which leads to that there is more to reality than can be contemplated meaning that its infinite. Thats chaper 2: like multiplication and division are much higher levels of mathematics than adding and subtracting, chaper 2 is higher than the starting points in chapter 1.
â€”â€”â€”
If you want to be altruistic/selfless you can think about the millions of lives lost or living as refugees due to religious wars and group-loyalties based on ideology/religion. What if group-loyalty could be, for everyone, based on a single universal ideology? Then friendship ties, shared histories, well-mixing personalities and the like would form groups that donÂ´t have a religious mission/an ideological drive. When all ideologies are erased â€“ and religions too â€“ then simple biological mechanisms like common goals, shared interests and family ties bind us together â€“ and those kind of conglomerations are more likely to disintegrate than if there is a holy book or any ideological book as the binding principle between people. If ISIS would be educated then it would disintegrate and many civil wars break out among different families in Iraq/Syria â€“ but there would not be this major cleft between western&modern and holy&dogmatic.
If you want to be selfish like Ayn Rand: the upcoming world order / economy will be a meritocracy based on who advances or knows the most science. The ancient Chinese had a government where even the lowest peasant, if he passed a test in ConfusciousÂ´ teachings, could elevate himself higher in the society. Hierarchy is based on what is objectively to be admired; hierarchy is based on what infinitely many extraterrestrials in consensus have agreed upon be the criteria for how a humanÂ´s thoughts should be wired; hierarchy is based on the universeÂ´s disposition to reward those with the most accurate world-view or whom advance the pre-existing world-view and spread it to others â€“ the universe wants us choose to elevate in the hierarchy those whom appriciate the universe most fully, wholistically and most accurately. The old power-system based on money is upheld by banks and is based on present day humansÂ´ ties to the past. There will be an overlap between the old bank-based system for establishing VIP-status and the new economy which is a meritocracy based on science. If we want to be like planets ahead of us in the evolution of history, we ought to adapt the meritocracy-economy. After a few generations inherited money seems less legitimate than knowing or advancing science and by doing so wiring oneÂ´s cortex (flexible thinking part of the brain) as universally as possible (as much like the consensus among extraterrestrials is as possible).
There are three universal starting points for the universal course which will wire your brain universally. What I mean by â€œuniversalâ€ is that:
A) it is based on science meaning that it is retrievable from anywhere at any time; it is available universally unlike some time-specific language-specific location-specific holy-book-revalation.
B) universal means that it is how aliens/extraterrestrials sooner or later wire their brains. Sure: they can choose to live in a multi-worldviewical world but sooner or later the truth will conquer meaning that all various ideas among every tribe or nation will congregate (like a lens focuses many beams of light into one focal point) into a single set of ideas and prioritarizations â€“ a single world-view will emerge from the many. It is the identical world-view that all civilizing planets will congregate to/toward because science is universal. This congregating is as much of a universal step in evolution as that a planet with water will eventually have bacteria. Eventually everyone will know the course and the idea of this book. â€œWhat do you believe?â€ will no longer be a question because everyone has wired their cortexÂ´s ideas based on universal ideas/science.
â€”â€”â€“
Am I a muslim?
I have my size-time-diagram into which everything fits and this diagram being infinite gives an existential theory because:
â€“ sizes justify (are the cause of) one another, so thereÂ´s infinite justification.
â€“ time is infinite and our universe is observed to become nothingness in the future, and nothingness would be absurd if not for the fact that in the smallest spaces energymass is summoned because E=mc2 is a stable, constant law of nature.
â€“ there can only be separate distinct entities if distinction is counter-balanced and happens in non-distinction (a singular Reality). This point is much like the previous point of that only in nothingness can somethingness be summoned.
God, then, if we are to look for a meaning for the word, cannot be:
â€“ a specific object, size nor time within something infinitely larger
â€“ cannot, by definition, be apart from and â€œbeyondâ€ [that of which all is part] (Reality). Reality being an infinite size- and time-range of energymasspacetime is enough of an existential theory to explain us being here, the Big Bang, and the rest of the questions. God would, if claimed to be â€œbeyondâ€ the existential theory, be an unnecessary unproven assumption but more to the point: God would be â€œunrealâ€ if Reality is defined as we define it here. Such â€œbeyond Realityâ€-gods are unreal. WhatÂ´s more is that the phrase â€œAllah akbarâ€ (God is the biggest/greatest) wouldnÂ´t be true if Reality/[that of which all is part] is God plus Reality â€“ if [that of which all is part] has two major components, God and an energymasspacetime sizerange etc (the existential theory), then the sum of those two components is greater than God.
God, thus, obviously means Reallity by the definition of God being the greatest. God is then infinite. It makes sense to see people in awe over how much they can study, when they know thereÂ´s infinitely many fields of science which we do not have access to but which are logical and necessities for Reality to hold together. There being nothing absurd in an infinite size-range that resembles our known size-range (from quantum physics to the visible universe) is awesome and the highest you could possibly worship. This again proves that God is just a synonym for Reality/the existential theory.
Having studied all fields of science i.e. all sizes is the known sizerange, seeing how they all make up (justify) eachother (that itÂ´s just zooming in and zooming out), the wisdom that the sizerange is infinite (that there are infinitely many sizes making up one another) from the distinction (I think & I am logical path) and anti-distinction (that Reality is one) -thing, is the reason why we exist and God is not some size (sizes are not minds, except through evolution). Having studied all known sizes and knowing that the sizerange is infinite: it is an explanation to why weÂ´re here (akin to the Adam and Eve story or â€œGod created earth in 6 daysâ€ story) but it is not a revalation-giving thing â€“ the Quran wasnÂ´t written by God because God is not the kind of thing that writes/dictates stories. God being an infinite sizerange as thus our Creator is true, but the true way to get knowledge, rituals/pictoral representations and even guidance is through my work, not the work of the holy book-writers. The holy book writers might have said something true about God (just like I do in my work) â€“ but that is true of science textbooks moreso â€“ and they all said false things such as that God talks/gives revalations/authors holy books.
I can see the bronze-age marketing-teamÂ´s standpoint: people are more prone to follow dictates if theyÂ´re said to come from something/someone â€œhigher than humanâ€ i.e. a God or a ghost/spirit. Being invisible in as nonsense-a-way as some rituals are, is great for marketing. Everyone knows how humans thing â€“ theyÂ´re themselves human; we are only partly rational (a computer is rational) in what we think â€“ all our animal lusts bias or interrupt the thoughts that are as logical as they get, but theyÂ´re always going to be based against an evolutionary background just like the pitfall that my abstract diagram-including infinity-mentioning world-view is more like algebra than â€œwhat a world-view (context in which we are) should be thinking about that we lived for millions of years on the savannah, only needing to know (in oneÂ´s world-view) where the water-source is or whom stands under whom in the social hierarchy. WeÂ´ve mapped geographies, the use-based properties of objects/tools and personalities (and still do) for a gazillion years â€“ only with the advent of science SOME of us achieved higher i.e. used their evolved meager toolkit with all its biases to scetch out something like the theory of evolution in the 1800s. Looking at the evolution of [what we use our memory for]/how we map our surroundings/our world-view, before we mapped social relationships we mapped geographies. Before we mapped the functions of inventions (tools) our map only contained caveman tools (sharp stones and spears). The next step is to map oneÂ´s context as an infinite size-time-diagram (where size and time are really the same, but abstract thinking allows us to separate them into two distinct axises) or energymasspacetime (with itsÂ´ many laws of nature found in every school textbook in the world) and the distinction-antidistinction-
thing which feels so awkward/abstract that one wonders why one needs it as pillar 3 of the existential theory: the answer is: it wasnÂ´t invented (the words â€œI see a distinct objectâ€ or â€œwhy is there distinction?â€ werenÂ´t said in the same breath as â€œReality is oneâ€ or â€œenergymass and spacetime uniteâ€) until I did it in the 21st century). It might seem trivial to mention that separate entities exist in a singular Reality â€“ itÂ´s so obvious (thatÂ´s why no-one cared to make a big fuzz out of inventing it) but it makes the existential theory have three pillars (all of which can seem obvious) and not 4 â€“ thereÂ´s nothing more to add to the existential theory once youÂ´ve added the obvious â€œseparation in antidistinctionâ€-statement. I want to know how aliens (the infinitely many of them, steered by science toward an incommon path) think because its synonymous to finding a TRUE â€œkey to historyâ€ (Marx thought the key was equality, Hitler thought the key was racial superiority and a brutally competative relationship between races, Capitalism thinks itÂ´s freedom (less government), some might think they â€œkey to historyâ€ is to fund technological development). â€œHow aliens thinkâ€ is a shorthand way of saying â€œthe key to historyâ€ or â€œwhat will happen next/eventually and in hindsight seen as akin to the era of ancient grecoroman culture, the Industrial Revolution or the Digital revolution)â€. ItÂ´s what weÂ´re steered towards; itÂ´s the closest thing we get to divine guidance. ItÂ´s simply universal (drawn on science and practiced by infinitely many aliens) guidance/suggestions/
recommendations that we, as a species, can choose to promogate and thus â€œfollowâ€ or if weÂ´ll stick to multiculturalismÂ´s many -ismÂ´s like political quran-based islamism or christian-based â€œthe holy book gave me thisâ€-morality and codes of conduct. Some -ismÂ´s are dangerous (like quran-based politics and law) while some -ismÂ´s like christianity give too much credit to the -ism for simple human decency (in an age of extreme wealth globally). When my tummy is full IÂ´m a decent person â€“ I try to make money but IÂ´m not desparate after extreme wealth because I know that my caveman-brainÂ´s â€œneedâ€ for power (through status-symbols and freedom of space my environment to maximize the effectiveness of my hobby (writing)) wonÂ´t get satisfied no matter what external extravaganzas trigger my eyeballs, nor can people (socializing) make me much more satisfied than I am right now because all that is interesting and that there is to people is their brain â€“ and after a few weeks together thereÂ´ll be nothing I know nor any mental tool that I use that wonÂ´t, despite copyright, be in the hands of my friend: we wonÂ´t talk science (me teaching him/her) after all the science has been taught. I donÂ´t care to teach trivia so when I say â€œI teach SCIENCEâ€ I mean a finite thing: the existential theory plus something from each level of the known sizerange. Getting a P.hD from specializing on finding the structure of a rare protein only found in the feet of Amazonian forrest-mice is to put your eyes too close to the diagram; P.hDs for specializing/having a very narrow topic for oneÂ´s mind to engage in are for people who donÂ´t see the forest for the trees and care to rather look at one leaf of one tree instead of thinking about and seeing the forest as a whole. IÂ´m a forest person â€“ a leaf 10 cm from my eyes just bugs me. ThatÂ´s why there is a finite repertoire to what I call â€œscienceâ€ â€“ it takes a few days for me (my accomplishment/my work) to be fully understood and if repeated repetative. One only needs to know why/where one exists (the existential theory) once â€“ one canÂ´t forget it because we are made to remember the very context in which we live (here an evolutionary bias helps us: when someone explains â€œwhat the world isâ€ we remember it because â€œwhat the world wasâ€ in caveman days was the most useful thing the brain could do â€“ in fact we evolved such large brains because bigger brains remember better (can moreso map social relationships, successfull or unsuccesfull learning-experiences). We want to climb upwards in the hierarchy, find a mate, etc but all these wants and needs would be useless (theyÂ´d having nothing to work on) if it werenÂ´t for the map (of social relationships etc) that our brain is capable of remembering. We are inclined to remember existential theories because such knowledge about our place in the context was as useful as mapping whom is married to whom. This bias, by the way, is something holy book writers used to get people interested in their book. â€œGod created earth in 6 days (not 5)â€ is memorable because of our bias toward wanting to know about â€œcreation of the worldâ€ â€“ so the number â€œ6 daysâ€ is remembered too because it adds to the map that we then work on to seek power and other evolutionary benefits. ItÂ´s hard to make plans that have one reach evolutionary benefits if one does not know oneÂ´s environment/the external world. â€œ6 days for creating this place/worldâ€ adds to oneÂ´s map of the environment/place/external world. We have a bias for remembering it. Too bad the bronze-age holy books used this marketing trick (â€œhey, letÂ´s say something about their world (like the creation of it) because that would be something they remember!â€) to give pseudo- existential theories. The holy books made sales because not only do people want information about their context, people also want God to talk and interfere with day-to-day personal activites. Once you have a pseudo-explanation for how/why the world was created, youÂ´re free to add to that pseudo-explanation that â€œthe creator talksâ€. ItÂ´s impossible to add such a talking thing to my existential theory â€“ not only is it unnecessary (my theory works stand-alone) but it also contradicts basically every concept of my existential theory. The very definitions of energymasspacetime (meaning that God had nothingness as the canvas to paint on â€“ a nothingness that needs energymass and summons it because of the laws of nature inherent in that nothingness â€“ and chose to paint a beginning with as-dense-as-can-be (just like E=mc2 wouldÂ´ve created it because E=mc2 is true in the smallest spaces). Where was God when this happened? CouldnÂ´t have been energymass because energymass is only summoned once the universe becomes pure nothingness. If God is not energymass and energymass is existence â€“ then God doesnÂ´t exist / God is nothing. What doesnÂ´t exist or is nothing doesnÂ´t give revalations to men, doesnÂ´t care whom you sleep with, etc. Is God or GodÂ´s heaven a location in our size of infinite spacetime? In that case God is simply a far-away alien (which warrants questions about its evolution) but again â€“ it doesnÂ´t talk to us because of the distance and we wouldnÂ´t be too impressed even if an evolved God did talk to us (we are quite like it â€“ our science is the same, our world-view is the same). God is not a location in a size but is God a size? The sizerange is infinite (as proven by distinction not being able to see antidistinction) and thatÂ´d mean that thereÂ´s a creator to God (and that thing too has a creator, ad infinitum) IN THE SAME WAY as humans built cities or atoms make molecules. Again, if God is a size it warrantÂ´s the question: is God every location of that size or is God, like humans, in a location of that size? Whatever be the case, God still couldnÂ´t communicate with us. Since God fits neither in the context of energymasspacetime nor the context of the sizerange, a God-theory absolutely contradicts the true theory. What is said about God â€“ that God is the greatest â€“ makes only one â€œlocationâ€/notion in the existential theory correspond to a non-talking uncaring God: the theory itself (and more precisely Reality/[that of which all is part]) is the greatest. It certainly doesnÂ´t hear/talk nor give revalations because it comes as an infinite sizerange of energymasspacetime. When you tell this science, you can get to the point where you define Reality as â€œthat of which all is partâ€ and the greatest â€“ you can even get to antidistinction/the unrepresentability of Reality (fully, because we do represent some things) and people might still hope that a talking God can exist. But as soon as you mention the less abstract (the more abstract was that [that of which all is part cannot be observed]), the God-theory either surrenders or is in conflict with a/the existential theory which certainly is true (anyone can verify how the components of the theory fit together, make sense and explain everything). God as a synonym for Reality is boring â€“ why do we even have two words if we mean the same (scientific sizerange) thing.
If you assume that God is a synonym for Reality (which comes as an infinite sizescale, which in turn predicts a DNA-strand somewhere and voila: everything is explained), then I believe in your God. It doesnÂ´t appriciate my appriciation of it though, nor do rituals, following rules (made by men) etc please it. If I am to â€œshow my appriciation to itâ€ I do it by writing as I do right now â€“ thatÂ´s my worship of it: but IÂ´m under no illusion that this writing would please God by being logical (eventhough Reality itself is logical too â€“ so we have something incommon) â€“ me writing can be called worship but the only appriciating recipients of my writing are me and readers of my text. Whatever I write about Reality/God doesnÂ´t please God (because God is not a thing that listens, likes worship by others and other human needs) â€“ whatever worshippers do, I hope they do it for themselves and for other humans because no-one else is able to care or comprehend the worship. I would do the muslim prayer if I felt that that kind of discipline would benefit me (and a few times I did get a good feeling from going to the mosque and being among worshippers). ItÂ´s so easy to adapt to the customs of oneÂ´s peers (and especially oneÂ´s superiors, if one believes that there are those) that my attitude toward worship/ritual is â€œwhen in Rome, do like the romans (if you or others gain something out of it)â€. The world is complex â€“ I could have the same attitude toward the beliefs of islam: that IÂ´ll just say that something is through eventhough it obviously isnÂ´t because it contradicts, say, a talking holy book-writing God. Could I make myself believe that something talkative is God? The belief disintegrates and I get the foul feeling of that IÂ´ve used my valuable memory to note down a lie everytime I would think just one step/association further from the belief itself. I can believe (in anything) but analyzing it even the smallest amount will make me disbelieve it. But when youÂ´re in the mood of not analyzing â€“ like when one is having a panic attack on oneÂ´s death-bed â€“ IÂ´ll be (extremely) simplistic and do what some people seem to always do: â€œbelieve (in something that breaks down when analyzed)â€. What confuses me is that some people believe all the time â€“ they seem perfectly sane but they believe in a talking, scripture-giving God (that doesnÂ´t fit anywhere in the existential theory). Do they need comfort (from untruth) all the time? It seems like theyÂ´re trying to argue their position, though. A perplexing phenomenon at first glance but when you consider that theyÂ´re uneducated about my existential theory, any theory will do (even a talking God-theory). I am not hateful of it when I see it in other people â€“ I see it as humorous/ridicilous â€“ but when it binds people together (to form what in essence is an army) and thereÂ´s many of them (10 000 religions/â€armiesâ€) the worldÂ´s got a problem. Binding people together through their shared scripture and their belief that something impossible is true is bad because groups tend to be more violent than individualists â€“ especially if their holy text 1) seems to bind billions of people to their army (morale-strength amplification in a group is the root of violence), and 2) preaches violence/disrespect (many holy books are xenophobic and eager to create an â€œus vs. themâ€-social dynamic). If the holy book is taken seriously (if it canÂ´t be thrown in the trash) then we have bronze-age xenophobia (based on who likes the book and who doesnÂ´t) creeping into the modern day, and we also have artificial bonding/loyalty â€“ we basically get groups who are hostile (or more disrespectful) toward anyone who doesnÂ´t see the point (â€œthereÂ´s a talking Godâ€) theyÂ´re promoting. ItÂ´s such an easily fixable problem: if you read my work you simply cannot believe in a talking God â€“ my professional role is that you can give me ANY individual and I can â€œconvertâ€ him/her into not believing in a talking God. Whether this person will follow his or her groupÂ´s rituals or codes of conduct, though, is up to them â€“ itÂ´s sheer peer pressure.
The â€œus vs. themâ€ â€œwe are a big groupâ€ (and especially) â€œwe should convert the whole world so that they use their precious memory for knowing nonsense like we doâ€ are such great reasons for violence â€“ and of course itÂ´s fixable because what these people lack is education: only where there is no theory, can a pseudo-theory take root. Only where there is no argument/debate/science can â€œGod talksâ€ seem like legitimate truth. This means that much of the worldÂ´s violence is due to a lack of education (about the big questions i.e. what I talk about). Sure: some religions can be interpreted to say â€œkill the infidelsâ€ or some other explicit declaration of war â€“ but itÂ´s hard for a religion to survive if it constantly preaces fighting (it must have more clever tactics than that â€“ but it does tend to seek world-dominion). IÂ´m not so worried that someone reads the Quran and thinks â€œIÂ´ll help the [unbelieves in the QuranÂ´s talking God] to get to hell faster, because the Quran says that thatÂ´s where they belongâ€. I am worried about that the Quran (or any holy book) is the glue that binds people together. Religion is the last glue before we enter an era where obviously arbitrary things like nationalism or language makes strangers feel more familiar with eachother. Nation and language arenÂ´t taken that seriously â€“ nor should religion be, but it is. This binding-effect that holy books have is what makes ISIS / the taliban etc so hard to defeat â€“ they think, not only that they have an all-seeing revalation-giving God on their side, but they also have the exact same copy of a book that a billion people have. They feel strong (with their, seemingly to them, superior numbers). Obviously ISIS underestimated the ability of the Quran to draw in arab nations into the fight over Iraq & Syria â€“ the modern world simply leaned on the fact that ISIS are not muslims because they interpret the bronze-age ramble wrong. But ISIS / the taliban is still a factor â€“ the quran binds too many people together in certain areas of the world â€“ violence is caused, due to the binding-effect, the â€œmoral superiorityâ€-effect, the â€œpower in numbers and billions of people read the Quranâ€-effect etc (all these effects are there even if you skip the parts about the talking God who word for word said the Quran) make men as prone to violence as anything can make them: theyÂ´re a group with an â€œus vs. themâ€ dogma & feeling and they feel like they have power in numbers. Add to that the frustration over having to finance an own home before one can ejaculate. Those circumstances can make the group take up arms and â€œsend the infidels where they belongâ€. Following the commandments frustrates, the whole notion of â€œletÂ´s all prioritize this text highest (our favorite book) so that weÂ´re bound togetherâ€ and that the text itself can be interpreted as violent all are a breeding-ground for trouble â€“ and when youÂ´re in the trouble that the text creates, you are not in the state of mind to do the internal debate necessary to disprove a talking God and thus make your whole way of life become something that you either do as meaningless fun or donÂ´t do because no-one cares. But just as some people want to become professional soccer players and some atheists do zen-meditation, humans (by personal preference) want hobbies, to take up a discipline, to do something that adds, say, pride to their life. I donÂ´t personally care about soccer and I donÂ´t feel pride from doing any ritual, but I can definitely see that others take the muslim prayers like an athlete takes their sport. ItÂ´s possible to find out the objective truth about whether these prayers â€œplease God or notâ€ (by, like IÂ´ve done in this text, disproving all kinds of false Gods and making the real God more mundane and not a talker). Rituals donÂ´t please Reality/â€the energymasspacetime sizerangeâ€ because it is not a thing that gets pleased â€“ itÂ´s like trying to please a rock. You do the prayers because you enjoy the pride/hobby for its own sake â€“ like someone doing sports likes his/her sport. Pleasing a rock/God to get to a â€œheavenâ€ (which too doesnÂ´t fit into the true existential theory) is stupid unless itÂ´s akin to a hobby/sport where you do it for doing itÂ´s sake. Same thing with the â€œheaven hates hamâ€-thing â€“ when you know enough science (enough = what IÂ´ve written so far in this text) youÂ´ll realize that the whole ham-prohibition is man-made (from the bronze age) and linked to some pre-scientific nonsense from-the-horseÂ´s-mouth-
statement (canÂ´t say rationale because itÂ´s dogma). If you (and secondarily your peers) are dedicated to nonsense (whether it be sports, stamp-collecting, memorizing capitals or not eating pork), then do it if it does something good like prove to yourself (and others) that you have a strong discipline (even though your effort is misdirected toward nonsense). I can invent a ritual and do it every day, and maybe IÂ´d feel pride over that I can keep to a schedule of nonsense, but I would never claim the theory that there is a talking God, and by extention I wouldnÂ´t say that that ficticious talker prohibited ham. The mundane action must be differentiated from the logical argument. Ham-prohibitions and talking Gods are artifacts that belong in the past â€“ modern white A4-paper is too beautiful for someone to write something as erroneous as â€œthere is a talking Godâ€ on it. But as IÂ´m writing this, people are dying because religion binds them together (and frustrates them, and boosts their war-morale in many ways). My work can cause a civil war within ISIS â€“ a civil rift so permiating that only family ties, friendships and common goals (to get money, not to spread islam) can keep people together in groups. Once my existential theory is known there will still be crime and instability in Iraq, Syria and Afghanistan, but the evil deeds will only be committed by groups of 2-3 people â€“ not 20 000 of them. The binding effect of the Quran can most clearly be seen in that internet-propaganda made Quran-readers from the USA and Europe go fight in Syria â€“ everyone wants a group and itÂ´s totally human to assume that knowing the same book will be enough for a bond to be as strong as one wants it to be.
Right now â€œmy workâ€ is 9 proper texts and a few videos. They all talk about the same thing (which can be formulated as: IÂ´ll say as much as I can about things IÂ´ve never heard anyone else say (and IÂ´ve seen the best professors in the world teaching truths)). To cause a rift in the taliban/ISIS and stop the war by making group-bonding (around a holy book) problematic/impossible, my whole â€œworkâ€ doesnÂ´t need to be dropped as propaganda books on top of ISIS and the taliban. ItÂ´s enough that the news headlines say that â€œa correct all-explaining existential theory has been found â€“ religions in crysisâ€ or that enough people know my theory so that a multitude of youtube videos are made where, in a sentence or two, the presenter goes off-topic and mentions why we exist / something from my theory. Having understood it once makes it impossible to forget â€“ having understood it once makes group-bonding over religion (which fuels ISIS/the taliban/etc) impossible. If the world could just take 20 minutes of itsÂ´ time to spend on explaining/teaching/arguing my work/theory, then the war on terror would be over â€“ otherwise it will persist as long as people have no actual, logical theory about their existence and thus believe in bronze-age marketing tricks.
â€”â€”-
The theory of evolution begins with the first reproducing shape. It was a shape that assembled surrounding mass into a similar shape. The existential theory predicts the existence of infinitely many such shapes. What inevitable becomes true when you have reproduction is that some die and some survive (life and death), that the number of offspring that shape make matters and that there is mutations over time. This is true about the shapeÂ´s offspring: some will die and some will survive, the number of offspring they make matters and the offspring can be different from the original shape. These three rules / laws of nature were inactive before the first reproduction occurred. The next main event was that one of these shapes found that if it injected its DNA into other shapesÂ´ reproductive mechanism, it exploited principle number two: that the number of offspring matters. It was the first virus: it hijacked othersÂ´ reproduction. The rule / law of nature that came into play with this event was that â€œpowerâ€ matters: hijacking othersÂ´ reproductive mechanism gives evolutionary benefits. Now weÂ´ve listed the four main rules that govern evolutionary theory: first came the three first, and then came the forth: power. The next main event â€“ to guard against viruses taking over all life / reproductive mechanisms â€“ was that an immune system evolved to protect against virusÂ´ hijack attempts. This required multicellularism. Just like immune systems prompt/require multicellularism, immune systems prompt/require multigenderedism: to win in the arms race against quickly mutating viruses two genders arose to amplify the mutations to the immune system. Mixing genes from two genders creates a more mutated immune system, which can keep ahead in the arms race against quickly-mutating viruses â€œtryingâ€ to mutate to bypass any immune system. The next main event is that one of these multicellular organisms â€“ a fish or worm â€“ of the male gender mutated to be agressive and defeat other males in battle. He wouldÂ´ve gotten access to many more females than his non-agressive counter-parts. This too can be called â€œpowerâ€ because the agressive male hijacks other maleÂ´s access to females by killing the males. This prompts the dinosaurs because larger muscle mass and shaper weaponry is better at killing off competitors. Amongst the dinosaurs there was the mother-offspring bond, placed there by evolution for the evolutionary benefits a mother gets from seeing an offspring survive to adulthood. This bond mutated to involve flock-members because a group working together out-competes any individualists when fighting over anything. The next main event was that someone mapped the flock, in his brain, as a hierarchy (up-down-axis) with the longing to dominate peers.

Dude, evolution has me try to maximize evolutionary benefits using my plans; im always thinking at full speed and pain drives that thinking. And i know for certain that all this pain is meaningless. Its a suicide recipe but what prevents me from suicide is the natural strength that stems from being the pinnacle of beasts who all have survived for generations.

New book 2017
Chapter 1:
What problem does this solve?
This solves a problem that becomes most visible 60 years from now when sea-levels rise, the economy goes into permanent decline and oil ends. ThatÂ´s when humans start to fight (and belong in world-view-based groups to do so). While the economy is still rising the clashes are few and far between â€“ Afghanistan, Syria, ISISÂ´ world-wide terror attacks (mainly muslim world-views clashing with tolerant world-views). When the economy starts declining thereÂ´ll naturally be more friction between groups, and groups are made up of world-views (people identify as in a group based on world-view).
Advancing the scientific world-view to the level where it explains our origin and thus invades religious intellectual turf, solves the problem of world-views colliding as war.
Chapter 2:
Certain truth â€“ I think & I am
You have a composite certain truth consisting of two certain truths: you can claim as certain that you think (because if you were being fooled: being fooled is thinking) and that you exist (because being fooled requires the one who is fooled to be there). I think and I exist is one statement but two truths. You can certainly claim to have â€œdistinctionâ€ because youÂ´re dealing with multiple separate distinct entities (such as â€œIâ€ and â€œthoughtâ€). One could put it, while seeing the certain truths â€œI thinkâ€ and â€œI existâ€, that the space between the two notions (thinker and thought) is the hallmark of distinction. The distance separating thinker from thought we can recognize as necessary for â€œdistinctionâ€ to be concluded as a certain truth arising, in a next logical step, from the original primary certain truth.
Everyone agrees they they themselves exist, because if one would get fooled in everyone one can be fooled in then one would exist there anyway and be fooled. So one knows that one exists. Then one also knows that one thinks because â€œto get fooledâ€ is a thought-process. Thus we have two things: I think and I exist. And the distinction between them: and on the flipside of the paper we have the opposite of that: anti-distinction, and this can also be called â€œthat of which all is partâ€/Reality. And since we are in the distinction-side of the paper when we see something; when we see something there is distinction between us and that thing. Thus we cannot represent or see that which is on the other side of the paper i.e. that of which all is part / Reality. Nothing can represent â€“ because it is distinct â€“ Reality. So whatever which is distinct cannotâ€¦ whatever that is observed or represented is distinct and therefore is notâ€¦ therefore does not represent Reality / â€œthat of which all is partâ€. So we have distinction and anti-distinction as opposing poles.
You have a certain truth which everyone in the whole world agrees upon. You think and you exist since if you were being fooled by an almighty demon youÂ´d still both think and exist. Then there are two things i.e. distinction. All is part of a single reality which is anti-distinction, there are no separate parts: reality is one. If we put distinction on the left side of the paper and anti-distinction on the right side then (we) distinction cannot see that of which all is part because â€œto seeâ€ is â€œto representâ€ and then one uses something to refer to reality. There is nothing outside reality which can refer to reality but instead reality is defined as â€œthat of which all is partâ€ and then there is nothing that can refer to all of reality. The opposition between the two sides of the paper (distinction & anti-distinction) makes reality as â€œthat of which all is partâ€-anti-distinction non-representable because representation always involves distinction. What we see, for example, is just parts of reality. The hypotheses can be infinitely much so there is infinitely much to reality. Sizes and times, that is. In the existential theory (â€œwhy we existâ€) there, thus, is an infinite size-range with time, energymass in spacetime (everything and nothing intertwined like in the E=mc2 equation â€“ energy equals mass times, well â€“ spacetime; multiplication is what unites energymass with spacetime). Then we have distinction and anti-distinction: separate things but all is part of a single reality. The existential theory with its three pillars, that is an infinite sizerange, energymasspacetime and distinction-anti-distinction-opposition, predicts that there should be a tiny piece of DNA which copies itself.
Then thereÂ´s another kind of revelation that got respect. Descartes who lived in the 1600s got respect, fame and was invited to live with the Queen of Sweden because he had gotten an idea which certainly told us something true. Revelations can either be con menÂ´s statements like they were from ape-man and forward, or they can actually claim something which is verifyably true. Descartes, propably having his mind overcrowded by the masses of revelations that had accumulated to his time, asked: â€œwhat would be true if all my statements were false?â€. What would remain if I tossed all my knowledge and ideas into the trash? Are we stuck with countless unverifyable statements, some contradicting eachother, not knowing which ones are true and which ones are not? Obviously not since statements about architecture are obviously true since they build houses, while contradictory statements do not. So Descartes dared to throw all his knowledge in the trash to see what remained. He found certain truth: that he exists â€“ because even if he was wrong or was being fooled in everything he thought to be true, thereÂ´d still be a â€œheâ€ there. He certainly exists no matter what. Same thing goes for thoughts: being wrong or being fooled is a thinking-process so even if he was wrong or was being fooled in everything he thought, thereÂ´d still be thought.
Socrates: So he figured out that he thinks and he exists.
God: These are not one statement â€“ they are two.
Socrates: What does that mean?
God: IÂ´ll tell you later â€“ just agree with me that there is distinction between thinker and thought â€“ that the statements are two. ItÂ´s building on certain truth, and itÂ´s possible to build a wholeâ€¦ whatever it is that â€œsaves the worldâ€ from the coming economic decline by having everyone build on certain truth until the God-debate is settled. Remembering â€œdistinctionâ€ (between thinker and thought) will prevent the horror-scenario of large-scale future wars between people group-bound by religions, and instead â€“ since everyone built a whole world-view on certain truth â€“ have a more stable decline in the future. â€œDistinctionâ€ i.e. remembering that there are two certain truths (thinker and thought) is a step on the way toward a plan that will save humanity from destroying itself as much as it would if we didnÂ´t build our world-views on certain truth.
Plato: So after an era of â€œrevelationâ€-revelations invented by anyone for whatever purpose, coming from DarwinÂ´s ape-manÂ´s revelations, Descartes, in the 1600s, invented a revelation â€“ certain truth: I think and I exist â€“ which got him invited to the Queen of Sweden for the rest of his life. People have always liked revelations and even verifyable truth-claims like DescartesÂ´ get respect.
God: I have set it as true that each one of you humans can verify in your own mindÂ´s eye that you do certainly exist and that there certainly is thought â€“ and thus there is distinction.
Darwin: Distinction is an abstract word. That two objects are separate/different from one another is one of those notions and ape-man never made into language â€“ there was never the evolutionary need to talk about â€œdistinctionâ€. Yes: one could say that one banana is different from another (and one wants the bigger one), but to have Distinction exist stand-alone as a distinct notion is abstract thinking and we are not evolved to do that. For millions of years the caveman word for â€œdistinctionâ€ was only used in a sentance â€“ not stand-alone as in â€œdistinction certainly exists because thinker and thought are both certain truthsâ€.
Chapter 3:
Distinction-antidistinction-opposition
The first proof for that the size-time-diagram is infinite is distinctionÂ´s (our) inability to see/represent anti-distinction.
Chapter 4:
Maximum size?
The second prooof for that the size-time-diagram is infinite is that if we imagine a partless anti-distinction then it has no distinction as in a â€œmaximumâ€ or â€œminimumâ€ size, i.e. the size-range is infinite.
Chapter 5:
Infinite size-time-diagram
Chapter 6:
Existential theoryÂ´s 3 pillars
Chapter 7:
Prediction of DNA

Everyone agrees on that reality is one. Because itÂ´s one nothing can represent it, because the representer too should be part of reality. That means that there is a size-time-diagram which is infinite. And thatÂ´s why we exist. Everyone agrees on this eventhough we are distinct unique individuals. We have this world-view incommon, with extraterrestrials too.

By being skeptical at every junction - every transition and every conclusion - you strengthen your belief in this ideology, resulting in a fuller dedication to the fact that your humannessÂ´ pinnacle is this course/sequence of thought. The more you are sceptic the more your religious and ideological conversion takes root, leading you to believe this is your highest level of humanness, then youÂ´ll be wanting to spread it to others because spreading it is free and it gives civilization to others. If you spread it theyÂ´ll share your painful meaninglessness and the joyous awe that comes from this. The ideology spreads because of what is said above, and once global itÂ´ll change the worldÂ´s emotional atmosphere to awe-inspiring meaninglessness from the various creator lordsÂ´ personalities that humans today have as religions. This is a civilizing-mission upon the world, ridding people of half-baked unscientific world-views and the emotions that come from seeing the big-picture wholistic summary of each individual world-view. The pinnacle of civilization - an atheistÂ´s God/reality - is meaningless but awe-inspiring and can be viewed and tattooed.
There are distinct things, separate entities - "distinction" is a legitimate word.
All things are part of "that of which all is part" aka. Reality; reality is one because you have never heard anyone say "yesterday I went to half of reality" or "I just came back from two realities to this one". Look up "reality" in the dictionary and you should find that it is "the one of which all is part" - it is not plural (youÂ´ll never hear someone talk about realities).
By being one it can be called "anti-distinction" because distinction means many. All distinction (all distinct objects) are part of reality/anti-distinction/one.
Representation can occur as eyes/neurons mapping objects, as money mapping objects that can be purchased or as anything spontaneously standing as a symbol for anything else. Regardless of brains being involved, a coffee cup - in the eyes of God - represents all of the known cosmos; "represents" is infinitely vaguely defined meaning anything represents anything. Yet all representation is distinction because it takes two to tango: representer and representee. By all representation being distinction, can representation represent anti-distinction? No, the two are opposites. Yet we do represent anti-distinction by talking about it; we do see our everyday life experience even though we said that anti-distinction/reality cannot be seen because of the opposition between distinction (all representation is distinction) and anti-distinction/"that of which all is part - one reality"). We do represent/see something but not all of anti-distinction; we see something but not everything; there is more to reality
than can be represented. Are there any limits to representation if "represents" is infinitely vaguely defined in the eyes of God? We can hypothesize infinitely much and yet anti-distinction (as a whole) would remain unrepresented. Reality is thus infinite and we always map less than all of it, regardless of the infinitely vague definition of "represents".
The opposition between distinction (representation) and anti-distinction (reality) that leads to the conclusion that reality is infinite can be drawn as two dots representing distinction on one side of a line and letting the other side of the line represent the invisible anti-distinction either by us not drawing anything there or perhaps drawing one dot to say that reality is one.
What is reality infinite in/as? E=mc2 teaches us that energymass (E=m) and spacetime (c2, because c is a distance over time) are together. This warrants the (single) word energymasspacetime. All objects have a size in space, a coordinate in space and a time, and they are made of energymass. Reality is infinite energymasspacetime. Energymass is a synonym for existence and spacetime is a synonym for non-existence. Just like in "every action has an equal and opposite reaction", spacetime cancels/balances energymassÂ´ existence.
That reality/energymasspacetime is infinite can be diagrammed as a size-time-diagram with infinity symbols in each of the four corners. Size is infinite toward the small and toward the large, and at each size you have an infinity of time (because spacetime is one thing and weÂ´ve proven that it (reality) is infinite).
That energymass exists because it exists in spacetime/non-existence is captured in the equation E=mc2
Our existential theory thus is "an infinite size-time diagram made of energymasspactime and distinction-anti-distinction-opposition" or "energymasspacetime as infinite size-time and distinction-anti-distinction-opposition" or "distinction-anti-distinction-opposition as an infinite size-time diagram made out of energymasspacetime".
It, in its awe-inspiring meaningless fashion, replaces God with itself - promoting atheism (atheists agree that reality exists and can call reality "God"). ItÂ´s obvious that an infinite energymasspacetime size-range does not, like the Quran claims, author books that prohibit pork; reality is not of an authorship nature.
The largest knowable for any planet is cosmology and the likewise smallest is quantum physics - humans exist as large compared to the smallest knowable as we are small compared to the largest knowable; we are in the middle of the knowable size-range. Evolution begins in our region of the size-range. The existential theoryÂ´s infinite size-range predicts that there should be a size where reproduction occurs - where a mass assembles surrounding mass into a similar shape.
Evolution begins simple and builds upon previous steps to become more complex over time, which is why it is diagrammed as triangle-shaped. The tip of the triangle meets the square size-time-diagram in the middle of the size-axis because thatÂ´s the size where evolution occurs. The rest of the triangle is floating in the 3
rd
dimension as to represent complexity instead of change in size.
You know for certain that you think and that you exist because even if an almighty demon was fooling you in everything you can possibly be fooled in, the fooling itself is a thought-process and therefore you know that thought exists (you think), and for you to be fooled you have to exist and therefore you know "I exist". Being fooled is thinking and a thinker is necessary for there to be someone to be fooled. So you know: no matter what, you think and you exist. Those are two things, right? TheyÂ´re both part of the same brain and the thought-process can become the analytical toolkit/thinker, but still we recognize that there are distinct entities - there is distinction. This can also be called separation. What is distinctionÂ´s opposite, anti-distinction? ItÂ´s one reality; that of which all is part; itÂ´s one and realityÂ´s definition in the dictionary is that all is part of it. If we write distinction (thinker and thought) on the left side of the paper and anti-distinction (reality; that of which all is part; one) on the right side of the paper - can the left side see the right side? No, because of opposition between distinction and anti-distinction. Because of there always being an observer (a thinker) and thus distinction in every observation and thus anti-distinction canÂ´t be represented/seen.
The brain evolved to deal with natural
occurrences
- there was never an event in history where something invisible was to be contemplated and dealt with. Thus we seem to assume that the thought-process went wrong when we say that distinction/us canÂ´t see anti-distinction/reality. But the thought-process didnÂ´t go wrong: all that it means is that there is more to reality than can be represented. Regardless of how vaguely "represents" is defined, say a coffee cup - regardless of brains being involved - is assumed to try to represent that of
which all is part, then anti-di
stinction - distinction - opposition (the opposition between distinction and itÂ´s opposite) makes the representation incorrect. We can ask if there in an anti-distinct "thing" is a maximum size and thus distinction? No. Likewise, another proof for that the size-range is infinite is that we do sense something (our everyday world) and can make hypotheses ad infinitum, and yet nothing represent
s ALL OF reality. Reality i.e. s
ize-time thus is infinite.
The infinite size-range is one
foundational idea
in the existential theory. Another
foundational idea
is energymass and spacetime being opposites but intertwined as in E=mc
2
(where c
2
refers to a speed which is space over time: spacetime). Multiplication joins energymass together with spacetime; nothing together with something/everything; existence together with non-existence. Why is there existence the shape of my body? Without going into the historical answer, one can explain it by saying that the body is something in (intertwined with) nothing, of a size in an infinite size-range (where the relationship between any two sizes (or objects of two sizes) i
s that they make sense of i.e. j
ustify one another). Then there too, as a third
foundational idea
, is distinction-an
ti-distinction-opposition i.e. w
e live in a single (not plural) reality but we see distinct/separate entities such as thinker and thought.
Speaking of spacetime, spacetime is the logical starting point for the time-based existential theory.
Nothingness (empty space) needs n
o prior justification nor reason to exist, because it doesnÂ´t exist. In it, however
, laws of nature are true i.e. i
t is not irrational / anti-logical, and among the many laws of nature there are those, including E=mc
2
, which mention energymass. Could energymass be "mentioned" without it existing? If yes, it would be absurd / anti-logical. Why would reality mention things that never exist? But since laws of nature are firm and because of our rule "what is mentioned must exist or must be summoned" we get, wherever (in the smallest spaces) that E=mc
2
is mentioned, existence and thus dense existence: a big bang.
All of the above is a rival theory to "God created earth in 6 days and rested on the 7th". It is unintuitive because it deals with things we didnÂ´t have to deal with in evolution: invisible energymasspacetime/reality/anti-distinction as a part of reasoning. It also has a multi-reason cause for our existence:
a
big bang combined with a 3-
foundational idea
existential theory which justifies size and energymass. It is abstract/scientific but canÂ´t be reduced into simpler terms. ItÂ´s the lowest common denominator that everyone can believe in (regardless of religion).
How many is reality?
How many is Allah? One. Can anything completely represent reality?
Can anything completely represent Allah? No. Is reality the greatest (if all is part of it)?
Is â€œAllah akbarâ€? Yes. Reality and Allah have these three things
in common.
Atheists agree that reality exists but an infinite sizerange of energymasspacetime and distinction-anti-distinction-opposition does not write books to prohibit pork.
How vaguely has reality defined â€to representâ€?
Infinitely vaguely â€“ anything can represent anything.
Is the representation/representer reality or Allah?
No.
Can anything represent that of which all is part?
No.
Then the size-time-diagram is infinite i.e. nothing represents reality. How many is it? How many is Allah? 1.
Did it sayâ€¦, or did it wri
te a book?
This disproves Allah writing the Quran.
Again: how much of reality can be represented by, say, a painting? The whole of it?
No, the whole of reality cannot be represented. Just like Allah canÂ´t be captured in a picture/word.
We can have hypotheses â€“ how many hypotheses can we have?
If reality is sizes & times, energymass and spacetime then the square-shaped size-time-diagram with energymasspacetime in each coordinate is the universal way to represent all there is to represent.
Does it write books? No, it is not of such authorship-kind nature.
â€œGod said to Muhammed word by wordâ€¦â€ is thus a false or at most metaphorical statement.
â€œYou have to do rituals in order not to go to hell, and in heaven you get 72 virginsâ€ is by the same logic also a false claim.
There are three alternatives as the foundation for this logic â€“ can you think of a 4
th
one?
1: Reality is a synonym for Allah
(and is more accurately â€œan infinite energymasspacetime size-range of distinction-anti-distinctionâ€
)
2: or Allah doesnÂ´t exist
3: or there are 72 virgins (not an alternative because reality is not of the nature, because it is size-time-energymasspacetime, to write books).
This, if read by terrorists, would make it impossible to remain terrorist.
In addition to the square size-time diagram with infinity symbols in each of itÂ´s corners, and the evolutionary triangle which designates that life becomes more complex as time goes on (the triangle originates at the central size of the known size-range), there is the following brain diagram:
You have a composite certain truth consisting of two certain truths: you can claim as certain that you think (because if you were being fooled: being fooled is thinking) and that you exist
(because being fooled requires the one who is fooled to be there). I think and I exist is one statement but two truths. You can certainly claim to have â€œdistinctionâ€ because youÂ´re dealing with multiple separate distinct entities (such as â€œIâ€ and â€œthoughtâ€). One could put it, while seeing the certain truths â€œI thinkâ€ and â€œI existâ€, that the space between the two notions (thinker and thought) is the hallmark of distinction. The distance separating thinker from thought we can recognize as necessary for â€œdistinctionâ€ to be concluded as a certain truth arising, in a next logical step, from the original primary certain truth.
Are all distinct entities part of a single reality if â€œrealityâ€ is defined as â€œthat of which all is partâ€? In other words: if we draw distinction on the left side of a paper and anti-distinction (distinctionÂ´s opposite: a singular reality â€“ that of which all is part. Zooming out summarizing maximally) on the right side of the paper, then can distinction represent the right side of the paper i.e. anti-distinction? How could some distinct entities depict the very opposite of what representation/distinction is? Any depiction/representation of anti-distinction/reality has at least three entities: thinker, space between thinker and thought, and thought. Separation/distinction is inherent in representation, thus anti-distinction is unrepresentable.
How vaguely has the universe/God defined what a representation is i.e. when a representation occurs? Our brains use neurons to represent, but what if â€“ instead of neurons (regardless of brains) â€“ the universe wills that any random object can be said to, as neurons do, represent reality? The universe has defined â€œrepresentationâ€ infinitely vaguely i.e. disregarding brains, any random object spontaneously is the symbol standing for all of reality â€“ because the universe defines â€œrepresentsâ€ infinitely vaguely. Despite the infinitely vague definition of what represents what, distinction-anti-distinction-opposition (the line separating the left side of the paper from the right side; the countering of distinction with anti-distinction) means that reality is not representable. If reality is anti-distinction then no distinction (representation is inherently distinction) can even, despite an infinitely vague definition of â€œrepresentsâ€, capture reality.
In
representations we can count at least three things and what weÂ´re trying to capture is one thing with nothing outside it. The fact that representations contain distinction makes capturing reality (all is one) impossible.
We can have infinitely many or infinitely large/substancefull representations/hypotheses â€“ such as an infinite size-time-diagram â€“ and though abstractly accurately pointing to reality, the universeÂ´s rule that nothing represents reality despite infinitely vaguely allowed representations of infinitely much, makes reality unrepresentable. This can only mean one thing: reality â€“ which we know as sizes and times (a size-time-diagram) â€“ is infinite. ThereÂ´s infinitely large and infinitely small with infinitely much past and infinitely much future. This square-shaped size-time-diagram i.e. our everyday experience of size-time has infinities all-over the place.
Energymass in spacetime: one in zero, existence in non-existence, something in nothing â€“ as defined by E=mc
2
where c
2
stands for speed (distance over time i.e. spacetime/zero/non-existence) and E=m referring to energymass (existence, something, all).
Distinction-anti-distinction-opposition: we live in a singular reality but we see multiple objects.
An infinite size-range.
The above three ideas are an existential theory (a theory which explains the existence of a reproducing shape and thus the dawn of evolution and thus our existence). It is modern to utilize three equal ideas to explain oneÂ´s existence â€“ all previous existential theories used
either a single idea (monotheism) or a saga (multiple mundane (not very scientific/abstract) ideas) to explain existence.
The predictive quality that makes this existential theory a scientific theory is that it, basing it off an infinite size-range of energymasspacetime and distinction-anti-distinction-opposition, predicts that in an infinite size-range there ought to be a size where reproduction occurs. The existential theory predicts the first DNA, and from there we get to the evolutionary theory.
The theory of evolution begins with the first reproducing shape. It was a shape that assembled surrounding mass into a similar shape. The existential theory predicts the existence of infinitely many such shapes. What inevitable becomes true when you have reproduction is that some die and some survive (life and death), that the number of offspring that shape make matters and that there is mutations over time. This is true about the shapeÂ´s offspring: some will die and some will survive, the number of offspring they make matters and the offspring can be different from the original shape. These three rules / laws of nature were inactive before the first reproduction occurred. The next main event was that one of these shapes found that if it injected its DNA into other shapesÂ´ reproductive mechanism, it exploited principle number two: that the number of offspring matters. It was the first virus: it hijacked othersÂ´ reproduction. The rule / law of nature that came into play with this event was that "power" matters: hijacking othersÂ´ reproductive mechanism gives evolutionary benefits. Now weÂ´ve listed the four main rules that govern evolutionary theory: first came the three first, and then came the forth: power. The next main event - to guard against viruses taking over all life / reproductive mechanisms - was that an immune system evolved to protect against virusÂ´ hijack attempts. This required multicellularism. Just like immune systems prompt/require multicellularism, immune systems prompt/require multigenderedism: to win in the arms race against quickly mutating viruses two genders arose to amplify the mutations to the immune system. Mixing genes from two genders creates a more mutated immune system, which can keep ahead in the arms race against quickly-mutating viruses "trying" to mutate to bypass any immune system. The next main event is that one of these multicellular organisms - a fish or worm - of the male gender mutated to be ag
g
ressive and defeat other males in battle. He wouldÂ´ve gotten access to many more females than his non-ag
g
ressive counter-parts. This too can be called "power" because the ag
g
ressive male hijacks other maleÂ´s access to females by killing the males. This prompts the dinosaurs because larger muscle mass and shaper weaponry is better at killing off competitors. Amongst the dinosaurs there was the mother-offspring bond, placed there by evolution for the evolutionary benefits a mother gets from seeing an offspring survive to adulthood. This bond mutated to involve flock-members because a group working together out-competes any individualists when fighting over anything. The next main event was that someone mapped the flock, in his brain, as a hierarchy (up-down-axis) with the longing to
be the top of the hierarchy. This capitalist striving for
the top made brains grew larger â€“ larger memory-banks, more accurate predictions and faster planning are all advantages coming from a larger cortex.
****
*
Power lead men to accumulate resources â€“ the very resources females needed for their children. Females care most about their children because they pass on their genes, so in finding a male they aim for loyalty plus status/power/placement in the hierarchy. Females think a lot about how others â€“ especially suitors â€“ perceive them and therefore males evolved the subconscious mechanism, to
keep womenâ€™sÂ´ attention, to push-pull i.e. to, in one coherent fluent conversation, both say negative feedback about the woman and positive feedback.
* We are trying to impress the â€œhierarchical topâ€ i.e. the god or king just like kids try to impress their parents. Since powerhungriness is infinite, the hierarchical top is infinitely far away and weÂ´re trying to impress it to gain resources/rewards and climb upwards.
It is a major historical event that there finally is an atheistic argument that is sh
aped like a university course: i
t is an existential theory plus evolution which not only doesnÂ´t need a personified god to function, but the
foundational idea
s (infinite sizerange of energymasspacetime and distinction-anti-distinction-opposition) canÂ´t have a personified god added to them as a 4th
foundational idea
without the theory sounding
ridiculous
. Not only does the theory not need a personified god but adding a god destroys the minimalistic rationally complete beauty of the theory. Gods uglify the theory. The dawn of the theory is a major historical event because never before has an entire course (beginning with certain truth, going through the existential theory and ending in evolution) been laid out in the intellectual debate of atheism, as an argument against a personified god.
This is argument against both theism and deism.
The anatomy in the brain from hearing certain truth (I think & I am) - the beginning of the course - creates the same neuronal pathways / associations between ideas in every single person who knows certain truth. The logical step to "distinction" is noting, as a meta-analysis of the primary certain truth, that one has many ideas (I think AND I am) and that one can take logical pathways to the next step in the course (distinction exists). Then juxtaposing anti-distinction with distinction creates the unseeable - "defying reason" (because reason is, in simple people, only visual) - conclusion that we/distinction cannot see reality/anti-distinction. The distinction-anti-distinction-opposition is hard to grasp because it - like formal logic or math - uses words instead of pictures (the linguistic brainhalf rather than the visual one). We evolved to be like "if I see it I believe it" and that was a good heuristic (rule of thumb) because practical sequences of events can be verified as true or untrue by visualizing them. But in this philosophy: no - it has to be linguistic that we deny ourselves the concept "all of reality", leading to the conclusion that there is more to reality than anything - however vaguely the universe has defined "represent" - can represent. This adds infinitely many sizes to our abstract size-range / size-time-diagram; it makes a square (with size on the y-axis and time on the x-axis) with infinity symbols in each corner, which in turn becomes a
foundational idea
in our personified-god-denying existential theory.
To come from certain truth, through mere logical steps (meta-analyses and juxtaposition of opposites), to an existential theory which predicts evolution is a major historical event in the history of atheism.
Thinker & thought leading to distinction leading to anti-distinction leading to that anti-distinction canâ€™t be represented leading to the foundational ideas of the existential theory, is the path of logic everyone should know.
It makes believing in God impossible.
I wrote a text which needs to reach terrorists because the text makes religious jihad something impossible to engage in. My message is a sequence of logic whichÂ´s conclusion is more knowledge about the God-topic â€“ which is a topic that engages religious terrorism.
Understanding this makes religious terrorism impossible to engage in.
As we go through the diagram, ask yourself at every step of the way: â€œwhat would aliens think?â€ i.e. is the diagram based on universal truths.
This part of the diagram is two sides separated by a line. On the left side we have distinction â€“ separate entities represented by two dots. LetÂ´s let the two dots be what we certainly know exists: thinker and thought. On the right side of the line I havenÂ´t drawn anything because the right side represents anti-distinction (reality; that of which all is part). If one were to draw something it ought to be one dot because reality/anti-distinction is one. But because it canÂ´t be represented (fully) due to distinction-anti-distinction-opposition it is more proper to leave it undrawn. There is however a right side.
Energymass (existence) and spacetime (non-existence) intertwined as in E=mc
2
allows for the word energymasspacetime. The two are opposites (part of realityÂ´s balance) and intertwined.
The size-axis, proven to be infinite by distinction-anti-distinction-opposition i.e. that the universe has defined â€œrepresentsâ€ infinitely vaguely and we do represent something with our words/eyes/etc. and yet nothing represents anti-distinction/reality because in every representation there is distinction.
The time-axis, proven to be infinite by the fact that space/size and time are one and the same spacetime.
The evolutionary triangle, triangle-shaped because evolution gets more complex over time. Originates in the middle of the known size-axis.
The brain, resulting from evolution.
The core of the self/brain is a cluster of cells which are constantly (except in sleep) activating the emotional repertoireÂ´s circuits. The emotions then activate a cortical plan which exists across the linguistic and visual brainhalves. The reason the function of having two brainhalves evolved is because the visual brainhalf can create sequences of imagined or remembered events and if the outcome of that sequence rewards the emotional repertoireÂ´s circuits, that plan is remembered/pursued. WhatÂ´s imaginable is possible/right/true and this makes the anti-distinction-part of this science something where people lose the thread.
See the diagram as a self-portrait: it has the current events in the brain, it has all of evolutionary past in the triangle and it has the existential context.
In a historical context the anatomy (neural connections between ideas and sequences of logic) created by this course is like a paradigm-shift into a new era of earth society - an era similar to that existent on infinitely many other planets who have come further than our midway-mark in a regular water-bearing planetÂ´s history.
Evolution, by beginning with "a mass that can assemble surrounding mass into a similar shape" steps forth from the existential theoryÂ´s infinite size-range of energymasspacetime. Assuming DNA is the replication-molecule, we can step - skipping over how cell walls evolved etc - to the fact that viruses mutate to hijack othersÂ´ reproductive system. This - in this universal inter-planetary extraterrestrial culture - is formulated, in books of logic, as first three rules arising (life/death, number of offspring matters and "there is mutation in each generation-shift") and then a forth rule arising (power, with viruses). This story - which in our course begins from a first reproducing shape and ends with finessing the anatomy of power in men - is visualizable like the caveman story-telling narratives we evolved to hear/see. We can proof-check its validity/possibility by following the narrative visually. The visual nature of evolution is in stark contrast to the purely linguistic/abstract nature of the existential theory.
Speaking o
f "abstract" descriptions i.e. d
escriptions that make it very clear to us that our understanding of the universe is a mere map (a reference) and not reality itself (mind you of PlatoÂ´s or KantÂ´s cave-metaphor and "the thing is not the thing itself" -philosophies)... The size-range of energymasspacetime,
at the size of quantum physics
has us describe photons etc using both the wave-description which focu
s
es on lengths of space (this is the "spacetime description") AND - in wave-particle duality - the energymass description that the energy of a photon is its color. Color (as perceived through the eyes), wave/spacetime-description and particle-energy/energymass-description all are valid descriptors of quantum particles. This ability of ours to describe any mass/phenomenon using both energymass- and spacetime-
descriptions runs throughout the entire size-range. You can imagine two lines - one representing energymass and the other representing spacetime - running vertically through the pictures on the size-axis. Adding complexity to this, there is likewise two lines - gravity and electromagnetism - both running through the size-axis, gravity having itÂ´s duality of energymass and spacetime descriptions and electromagnetism too having both, in every level of the size-range, energymass and spacetime descriptions. Gravity is both Newtonian "masses pulling toward masses" (energymassÂ´ focus on mass) and Einsteinian "curvature of spacetime" (spacetimeÂ´s focus on space) - both descriptors are accurate.
From having read this book, the following should now be understandable:
Certain truth leads to the conclusion â€œdistinctionâ€, and simultaneously warrants an anti-distinction defined as â€œthat of which all is partâ€. The opposition between distinction and anti-distinction â€“ despite â€œrepresentationâ€ being ubiquitous (infinitely vaguely defined) â€“ together with the â€œmax size?â€-question asked in anti-distinction â€“ supports the fact that reality i.e. size-time is infinite. This then becomes our
foundational idea
in our existential theory that moves God away from a creator role. The two other
foundational idea
s are energy
masspacetime (found in E=mc
2
) and the opposition that we live in a singular reality yet see multiple things. From the middle of the known size-range (which itself is part of the infinite size-range) comes the tip of a triangle which symbolizes evolution. From evolution, then, comes the brain diagram with dopamine & serotonin across the visual and linguistic brainhalves, and a lower box which is our 3-category emotional repertoire; the most common 4 emotions in our idle society being power-hungryness (how to elevate oneself in the socioeconomic hierarchy if one is a man; and for females itÂ´s mapping the status-hierarchy of men in their social group as to find them differently attractive), expanding oneÂ´s world-view, planning sex and planning resource-gathering/work. This makes for a multi-symbol diagram involving the existential theoryÂ´s three
foundational idea
s holding up the square-triangle-brain (size-time-diagram, evolution, brain) diagram.
Certain truth is or leads to distinction, which itself â€“ as all distinct things are â€“ is part of anti-distinction. This is like saying obvious things about the reality/everyday world in front of us: such as that size is infinite and that it is something in nothing. All this, in turn, leads us to draw a square: a size-time diagram with infinity-symbols in all 4 corners. From the middle of the known size-range, then, comes a triangle â€“ evolution â€“ which ends
up in the brain with serotonin, dopamine, two brainhalves, a cortex and an emotional repertoire (upper- and lower box). In the emotional repertoire there are 4 idle emotions, among them â€œseeking powerâ€ â€“ power here is defined as outcompeting other males (if oneself is male) in a status competition, but the principle of diminishing other malesÂ´ reproductive capabilities happened at several stages in evolution: males fighting males (growing bigger to become dinosaurs) or viruses hijacking reproductive mechanisms of single-celled organisms. The search for power thus has led to brain-size growing (when competing for upwardness in hierarchies) but also things like T-rexÂ´s claws or the 1918 flu â€“ not to mention war.
You know for certain that you think and that you exist because in the event that you were being fooled (or threw all your knowledge in the trash) you would "think" because being fooled is a thinking-process and you would exist because "being fooled" implies that there is someone there who is being fooled.
There is distinction between thinker and thought. There are separate entities. "Distinction" is one logical step from certain truth.
All is part of a single reality - "all as one" is anti-distinction (the opposite of distinction).
Can thinker or thought see anti-distinction? Can distinction represent anti-distinction? The opposites cannot catch one another.
Is there thus distinction in the form of a maximum or minimum size (or time) in anti-distinction? No, therefore size and time are infinite.
Another proof for that the size-range is infinite is that the universe defined "represents" infinitely vaguely, meaning that this text - in the eyes of God - is attempting to represent "that of which all is part"/reality as one, but fails because representation is distinction and reality is anti-distinction.
At every size you see energymass (existence) and spacetime (non-existence) as intertwined, as in E=mc
2
(where c
2
is spacetime). Because E=mc
2
is true in every size (including the smallest ones) the Big Bang gets summoned as dense when there is nothingness. Telescope observations show that nothingness is coming in the future again.
An infinite size-range of energymasspacetime and distinction-anti-distinction explains our existence better than God.
The square in the diagram is a size-time-diagram with size on the up-down-axis and time on the horizontal axis (because it is universal to the history of science to discover the large and small by looking up and down respectively). The size-range is represented again under the square as ten lines stacked on top of one another. Human bodies are approximately as large compared to the smallest known as humans are small compared to the largest known, meaning weÂ´re in the middle of the known size-range. The ten-lines-on-top-of-one-another size-range is one out of three
foundational ideas which holds up the upper part of the diagram. An infinite size-range is one of three fundamental ideas in an existential theory and the upper part of the diagram with its square size-time-diagram and triangular evolution is the symbol for the cause of our existence, and it is connected to the three
foundational ideas that explain why there is evolution in the first place.
Previous atheists have moved God from a place where do intervenes in everyday life using miracles, to a God that set everything in motion but then doesnÂ´t intervene. My philosophy places God as a bum who watches a skyscraper get built â€“ the bum then gets praised for the skyscraper getting built even though the bum didnÂ´t contribute anything: at most he watched
as other mechanisms got everything done. Or God is a football fan who cheers at the players but doesnÂ´t himself contribute to making goals. Natural mechanisms create the world â€“ no need to praise God.
We are half-way in a planetÂ´s history â€“ 4.5 billion years have passed and 5 billion remain. The theory you now know is, in other words, in cosmic majority â€“ more planets have it than not (if it takes approximately half of a planetÂ´s history to invent it and if it remains true for the rest of the planetÂ´s history). Most other planets i.e. the majority of extraterrestrials are ideological adherents of the theory. Spread this theory to get approval of the majority even though it lives light-years away. Currently 99.9% of the worldÂ´s population lives in the era of religions â€“ spread this theory to end religious wars and terrorism like 9/11. The world-view (the view/diagrams that explain the world) is the same in the cosmic majority.
IÂ´ve worked 10 years to invent this theory and as alone bearing it itÂ´s my responsibility that it spreads. The future civilization in which everyone has the same world-view thus is dependent on me. I feel a
unique ability to influence earthÂ´s future.
You, as one who has partaken of this rare knowledge, should also feel a responsibility about spreading it to change the world.
